"Uh, Mr. Peterson, please come in and have a seat. I'm Dr. Grant."

"Thank you, Doctor."

"Now, I understand you're here today because of persistent abdominal pain and some changes in your bowel habits?"

"Yes. It's been going on for, well, several months now. The pain is mostly in my lower abdomen, and it's like a cramping feeling. And, the, the diarrhea is frequent."

"Frequent as in, like, how many times a day?"

"Four, five times? Sometimes more. And it's often quite urgent. Like I have to rush to the bathroom."

"Right. And any blood in your stool? Or mucus?"

"Yeah, I've seen some blood and some mucus too, I think."

"Okay. And any weight loss? Nausea? Vomiting?"

"I’ve lost about 4.5kg  in the last two months. And some nausea, yeah. But no vomiting yet."

"Right, and your medical history? Any previous surgeries or relevant conditions?"

"Just the appendectomy when I was younger, and I have high blood pressure, which I take medication for."

"Okay, and your family history? Any inflammatory bowel disease or colon cancer?"

"My father had, uh, diverticulitis I think. And my grandfather, on my mother's side, he had colon cancer."

"Right. Okay. That's significant. Now, I’m going to perform an abdominal exam. Please, let me know if you experience any discomfort."

"The abdomen is soft, but there is tenderness in the left lower quadrant. No rebound tenderness noted. Bowel sounds are hyperactive. No masses are palpable. There is some mild guarding."

"Okay, Mr. Peterson, I’ve completed the exam. We’ll need to do some further investigations. I’m concerned about the possibility of inflammatory bowel disease, given your symptoms and your family history. And, possibly, we need to rule out other things."

"Inflammatory bowel disease? Like Crohn’s or colitis?"

"Yeah, those are possibilities. Uh, we need to get a definitive diagnosis. I’m ordering a colonoscopy to visualise the colon and take biopsies. And, um, a stool study, to check for infections and in, inflammation markers. And a calp- [laughter] calprotectin level, also a marker of inflammation."

"A colonoscopy? I’ve heard those are uncomfortable."

"Use sedation to make you comfortable. And it’s, it's really the best way to get a clear picture of what’s happening in your colon. We’ll also do blood work, uh, a complete ba- blood count, um, comprehensive, uh, metabolic panel, and ESR and CRP, uh, which are all inflammatory markers."

"Now, let’s review your lab results. Your ESR and CRP are elevated, indicating inflammation. Your calprotectin level is, is also high. The stool study is negative for bacterial infections, but there are elevated fecal leukocytes, also pointing towards inflammation. Your CBC shows a mild anemia. Your CMP is normal though."

"So, what does that mean?"

"It means there’s definitely inflammation in your colon. The elevated inflammatory markers, combined with your symptoms and the physical exam findings, are consistant for inflammatory bowel disease. The colonoscopy will give us a definitive diagnosis."

"Okay, now, the colonoscopy results. As suspected, uh, there are findings consult- consistent with ulcerative colitis. There is continuous inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid colon. The biopsies confirm the diagnosis."

"Ulcerative colitis? So what does that mean for me?"

"It’s a chronic inflammatory bowel disease.Uh, we need to discuss treatment options. There are medical options available, including medications to reduce inflammation and manage symptoms. We’ll start with medical management and see how you respond. If the symptoms persist or worsen, w- we’ll consider other options."

"For medical management, I’m prescribing an aminosalic- oh, aminosalicylate medication [laughter], and we’ll start with a low dose and adjust as needed. We’ll also discuss dietary modifications, such as a low-residue diet, which can help manage the symptoms. And stress management techniques, such as yoga or meditations, can also be helpful."

"Dietary changes? Okay, so what kind of foods should I be avoiding?"

"Well, we’ll provide you with a detailed list. Generally, you should avoid high-fiber foods, uh, dairy products, and spicy foods during flare-ups. And we’ll discuss how to gradually reintroduce foods as your symptoms improve. We also need to talk about smoking, i- if you do smoke, as it worsens this condition."

"We will also need to discuss long term management. Urm, Ulcerative colitis requires ongoing monitoring and treatment. We’ll schedule regular follow-up appointments and colonoscopies to monitor the disease activity and we'll adjust medications as needed. We want to prevent complications and improve your quality of life. We will also need to discuss the risks and benefits of immunosuppressant medications if the initial medications don't work."

"Okay. I understand."

"I’m scheduling you for a follow-up appointment in one month to check on your symptoms and your medication tolerance. We will also discuss the dietary modifications in detail. Do you have any questions?"

"Just, um, what are the long-term risks?"

"Well, uh, the long-term risks include complications such as um, strictures, fistulas, and an increased risk of colon cancer. That’s why regular monitoring and treatment are essential. We’ll discuss all of these in detail as we go along. Uh, my nurse will give you the prescriptions and schedule your appointments."

"Okay. Thank you, Doctor."

"You’re welcome, Mr. Peterson. Uh, we’ll get this under control."
