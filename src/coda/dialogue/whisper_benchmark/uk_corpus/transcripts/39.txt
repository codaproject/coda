Hi there, Mrs. Thompson! It's great to see you again. How've you been feeling since our last visit?

Oh, hey Dr. Green... I'm doing pretty good, thanks. Feeling a bit tired lately, but overall, not bad.

Hmm, tiredness—let's dig into that in a bit. First, any changes to your health since last visit?

Um, not really... just, still having that mild nausea from the meds, but it's manageable.

Okay, still on the nausea. Uh, are you still taking the ondansetron for that?

Yep, uh... usually twice a day, sometimes I forget the evening dose.

That's understandable. It's tough keeping track. Any other medications you're currently on besides the chemo and nausea meds?

Just the, uh... my thyroid medication—levothyroxine. And ibuprofen for occasional headaches.

Any allergies we should remember? I have penicillin and sulfonamides in your records.

Yep, that's it. Penicillin gave me a rash and sulfonamides, um, caused shortness of breath.

Okay. How about any surgeries or hospitalisations recently, since our last check?

Nope, nothing new there. Still just the surgery I had for breast cancer two years ago.

Right, lumpectomy, I remember. And chemo started about six months ago.

Exactly, yeah.

Alright. And no recent hospitalisations or emergency visits?

Nope, nothing like that, thankfully.

Great. Anything else medical-wise I might've missed since last time?

Hmm, I don't think so. Oh! Well, I guess, sometimes my joints ache a little. Like, mostly knees and hands.

Could be related to chemo. I'll note it down and we'll monitor that. How's the family? Still have good support at home?

Yeah, definitely. My husband's been great, and the kids have been helping around more lately.

Excellent, glad to hear that. Are you working right now or still on leave?

Still on leave, planning to go back part-time next month if things keep improving.

That's encouraging. Any issues with alcohol, tobacco, or other substances?

No, never smoked, and only occasional beer, like once a week maybe.

Got it. Let's go ahead with a quick physical exam then. Can you take a deep breath for me?

Lungs sound clear, good. Any shortness of breath lately?

Nope, breathing feels normal.

Excellent. Checking your heart now... any chest pains, palpitations?

No, nothing like that.

Great. Heart sounds good. Can you lie back please? I'll quickly check your abdomen.

Sure.

Any tenderness or discomfort here?

Mmm, no, feels fine.

Good. Checking your legs—any swelling recently?

No swelling, just achy like I said earlier.

Alright, no oedema. How about your lymph nodes—any unusual swelling that you've noticed?

Uh, no, I haven't noticed anything strange.

Perfect. Sit- Sitting back up is fine now. Neurologically, You have- have you noticed any numbness, tingling, or weakness?

No, thankfully not.

Uh, that's reassuring. Your exam today looks good. Let’s, uh, circle back quickly to the fatigue—would you say that's interfering with your daily activities significantly?

Um, not too badly, I just feel wiped out by late afternoon most days.

Okay, that can be pretty normal with chemotherapy. Maybe scheduling short naps midday could help.

Yeah, I’ve tried that a bit and it helps.

Great, keep that up. Let’s keep monitoring everything. Any other concerns or questions for today?

No, think we covered it all.

Alright, good. Keep up the great work, Mrs. Thompson, and we’ll see you in four weeks for your next check-up.

Sounds good. Thanks, Dr. Green.

You’re welcome. Take care and say hi to your family for me.

I will. See you next time!
