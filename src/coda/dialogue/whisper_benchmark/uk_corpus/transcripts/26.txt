Good morning, Ms Carter. I'm Dr Lewis. How are you doing today?

Hi, good morning, Doctor. I'm doing okay, I guess. Just a bit nervous, to be honest.

That's completely understandable. What's brought you in today?

Well, my primary doctor found something... a lump, in my breast, and he referred me here.

Okay. We'll definitely look into that. How long ago was this lump first noticed?

Maybe...um, about two months ago. It feels like it might've grown a bit.

Okay. Have you experienced any pain or discomfort?

No pain, really. Just feels unusual, ya know?

Alright. Have you experienced any weight loss, fever, or night sweats recently?

Not really... well, maybe a couple of kilos, but I've been stressed lately, so I thought that's why.

Understood. Let's talk about your medical history briefly. Any, um, previous medical problems?

I have high blood pressure, and that's pretty much it.

Okay. Are you taking medications for your blood pressure?

Yeah, lisinopril. I think it's... 20 mg, once a day.

Any allergies to medications that you're aware of?

No, not - not that I know of.

Noted. Any surgeries in the past?

I had my appendix removed when I was 14.

Okay. And socially, do you smoke or drink?

I smoked in college. I quit, like, 10 years ago. And I drink wine mostly, maybe one glass a week.

Okay. Do you have a family history of breast cancer or any other types of cancer?

Um, my mum had breast cancer when she was around 50, but she’s okay now.

Alright, thanks for sharing. I'm glad to hear she's doing well now.

Okay, I'd like to perform a quick physical exam now. Is that alright?

Yeah, sure, go ahead.

I'm just gonna examine your neck first. Any discomfort here?

[cough] Nope, feels fine.

Lungs sound clear. Could you take a deep breath for me? Good.

Heart sounds normal as well. Let’s move to your breast exam. Which breast has the lump?

The left one. Right... right, here.

Yes, I feel what you're describing. It’s about two centimeters, firm, movable.

Is that bad?

Not necessarily. It could be benign, but we'll need imaging to know for sure.

Okay that’s reassuring. I was really worried it might be cancer.

Well, we'll definitely figure it out together. I'll order a mammogram and ultrasound for you.

Oh thanks. So, what should I expect next?

Once we have those results, we'll discuss them at your follow-up appointment next week.

Great, thanks again for explaining everything.

No problem at all. Do you have any other questions before we wrap up?

I think that covers everything for now.

Alright, nice meeting you today, Ms. Carter. We'll see you soon.

Nice meeting you too. Thanks again.
