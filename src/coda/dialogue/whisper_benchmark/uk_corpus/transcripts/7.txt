"Mr. Henderson, please come in. Have a seat. How are you feeling today?"

"Not great, Doctor. The chest pain's been worse, and… well, the swelling in my legs hasn't gone down."

"I see. Let's start with the chest pain. Can you describe it? Is it the same as before?"

"It's… sharper, I think. And it comes on more frequently. Especially when I try to do anything. Even walking to the bathroom."

"And the location? Is it still substernal, radiating to the left arm?"

"Yeah, exactly. And sometimes, I get a… a tightness in my jaw. It’s, it's concerning me."

"The jaw tightness is concerning. We need to address that. And the leg swelling? Any improvement since your last visit?"

"No. If anything, it’s worse. My shoes barely fit. And I’ve noticed some… shortness of breath, especially at night. Lying flat is difficult."

"Okay. That’s concerning. Uh, orthopnoea. We need to evaluate that further. Let’s review your medication list. Are you taking everything as prescribed?"

"Yes, I think so. Uh, the lisinopril, the, uh, metoprolol, the, uh, furosemide… and the aspirin, of course."

"And the nitroglycerin? How often are you using that?"

"More than before. Maybe… three or four times a day. It helps, but… not completely."

"Three or four times is significant. We need to adjust your antianginal therapy. Now, regarding your labs from last week. Your creatinine has increased slightly, and your potassium is still borderline. We need to monitor that closely. And your BNP is elevated."

"BNP? What does that mean?"

"It’s a marker for heart failure. The elevation, combined with your symptoms, suggests… a worsening of your condition. We also need to review your latest echocardiogram. It showed some progression of your left ventricular dysfunction."

"Oh… I see. So... So, things aren’t… good?"

"Mr. Henderson, we need to be very proactive. Your symptoms and lab in- uh, results indicate a need for immediate intervention. We’ll need to adjust your medications and possibly consider further testing. I’m also concerned about the jaw tightness. We need to rule out an acute coronary syndrome."

"An acute… what?"

"A heart attack, Mr. Henderson. We need to do an ECG, and possibly repeat the troponin levels. We also need to address the fluid re- retention. I’m thinking we need to increase your furosemide dosage. And possibly add a potassium supplement."

"Okay. Whatever you think is best, Doctor."

"We’ll also need to discuss your diet. Low sodium, fluid restriction. And we need to monitor your weight daily. I want to see a decrease in your leg swelling."

"I… I have been trying to watch my salt intake."

"I know. We need to be stricter. And we need to discuss your activity level. I understand that you’re experiencing chest pain, but we need to find a balance between rest and gentle activity. We also need to look at your sleep, because the orthopnoea is very concerning."

"It’s hard to sleep. I, I wake up gasping for air."

"We need to address that. Are you using any pillows to prop yourself up?"

"Yeah, three or four. It helps a little."

"Okay. We may need to consider oxygen therapy at night. We’ll discuss that after we get the repeat echocardiogram and the stress test results. Speaking of which, when was the last stress test?"

"About six months ago, I think."

"We’ll need to repeat that. And I’d also like to get a coronary CT angiogram. Given the jaw tightness and the increased chest pain, we need to get a bett- better look at your coronary arteries."

"That sounds… a lot."

"It is. But it’s necessary. We need to get a clear picture of what’s happening. We need to be aggressive. We also need to talk about your stress levels. Are you experiencing any… emotional distress?"

"Well, yes. This is… worrying me. And, and my son… he- he’s having some troubles. That’s been on my mind."

"We need to address that as well. Stress can exacerbate your heart condition. We’ll discuss some rela- relaxation techniques and possibly consider a referral to a therapist. We also need to get you set up with a cardiac rehab program as soon as possible."

"Cardiac rehab?"

"Yes. It’s a supervised exercise program designed to improve your cardiovascular health. It will help you regain strength and endurance. And we will have to look at your blood sugar again, as you have a history of pre-diabetes."

"Okay. I, I understand."

"I’m going to schedule you for an ECG, blood work, repeat echocardiogram, a stress test, and the coronary CT angiogram. We will also adjust your medications today. We will see you back in one week, and we will review all the results then. Do you have any questions?"

"Just… Am I gonna be okay?"

"We’re going to do everything we can. We’re going to be aggressive. We need to work together. And we will. My nurse will give you the paperwork for the tests and the medication adjustments."
