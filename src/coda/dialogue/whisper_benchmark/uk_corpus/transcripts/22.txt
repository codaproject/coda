Good morning, Mr. Thompson. Uh, how have you been doing since your last visit?

Good morning, doctor. Um, pretty good, I think. Well, mostly.

Could you tell me more about 'mostly'? What issues have you been experiencing?

It's mainly this... this persistent heartburn, especially after dinner.

Alright. Um... when did this start to worsen?

Mmm, maybe two or three weeks ago? Yeah, about then.

Have you noticed any particular foods triggering it?

Uh, spicy stuff mostly. Pizza, too. Anything greasy, really.

Have you been experiencing any nausea, vomiting, or weight loss?

No vomiting, but I do occasionally get nauseous. Uh, I haven't really lost any weight.

I'll note that. Any trouble swallowing or feeling like food is stuck?

Mmm, no. Nothing like that.

Alright. Any changes in your bowel habits? Diarrhea or constipation?

Uh, no. [clearing throat] Nothing significant.

Good. Let's quickly review your past medical history. Hypertension, correct?

Yep, that's right.

Any other medical issues? Diabetes, heart problems, liver issues?

No. Just hypertension.

Any past surgeries? Or abdominal surgeries, endoscopes previously?

Um, I had my appendix out about 15 years ago. But nothing recent.

Right, got it. Uh, medications, are you still taking the am- amlodi- amlodipine?

Yea, every morning.

Okay. Anything over-the-counter; medications or supplements? Antacids maybe?

Oh, yeah, Tums sometimes. Maybe twice a day.

Okay. Any allergies to medications or food?

Not that I know of.

Okay. And socially, any changes? Smoking, alcohol consumption, or diet?

I still don't smoke. I drink occasionally—maybe a beer on weekends.

Do you exercise regularly?

I try. Probably twice a week at the gym.

That's good. Uh, let's proceed to your physical examination now.

Your heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Deep breaths, please.

Lungs clear bilaterally. Alright, lay back please.

Any pain when I press here?

Um, slightly uncomfortable, but not really painful.

Okay. No significant tenderness, no masses. Okay, sit up please.

From your history and examination, your symptoms seem, uh, gastroesophageal reflux disease. Uh... [clears throat]

Alright. Um, is there something I should take?

Yes, I'll prescribe omeprazole, 20mg daily, and recommend dietary modifications.

Dietary modifications, like avoiding spicy foods, right?

Exactly. Also avoid eating late at night. Uh, let's follow up in four weeks.

Sounds good. Thanks, doctor.

You're welcome. Take care, Mr. Thompson.
