Hi! Good morning, Jamie. Good to see you again. How've you been doing lately?

Hi, Dr. Clark! Good, thanks. Um, mostly okay, but honestly, I've been a little bit stressed lately.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Anything particular going on, or just general stress?

Well, just, some stress at work, and, my periods have been really irregular again.

Oh, we’ll definitely talk about that. Let's start by updating your chart. Any changes to your medical history since last visit?

Hmm, no, nothing new medically. I’m still taking levothyroxine for my thyroid.

Still at the same dose? 50 milligrams, right? Oh, micrograms even.

Yeah, exactly, still the same dose.

Good. And are you still taking prenatal vitamins, or did you switch back to a regular multivitamins?

Oh yeah, I switched back to a regular one after breastfeeding stopped.

And how long ago was that now?

Um, let’s see... like 6 or 7 months ago now.

Oh okay, got it. Any allergies you haven't mentioned before? Food, medicine, anything?

Nope, still no allergies.

Great. Remind me, any surgeries in the past?

Just the C-section last year. Nothing else.

Right, and you healed up well from that, right?

Yeah, it healed pretty nicely, actually.

Oh that's good to hear. Okay, now, let’s get back to your irregular periods. Tell me more, what’s been going on?

It's just that some months they're like, super heavy, and others they're barely there. Like, I might spot for two days, and then next month it's, you know, really heavy.

Got it. How long has this irregularity been happening? Is that since breastfeeding ended, or earlier?

I guess maybe since breastfeeding ended, now that you mention it.

Okay, that's helpful. Are you experiencing any pain or cramping?

Yeah, some months it’s pretty bad. Other months, not so much.

Okay. Do you find you need medication for the cramps, or can you manage without?

Usually just ibuprofen. Sometimes heating pads.

Okay. And are you sexually active right now?

Yes, active.

Any contraception methods currently?

Just condoms right now.

Are you considering other options, or are you happy with that for now?

I’m thinking about maybe getting an IUD, but I'm still unsure.

Okay, we can definitely talk more about that. Let me quickly update your social history. Still working full-time?

Yeah, full-time. Remote, thankfully.

Oh nice! Drinking alcohol, smoking, anything like that?

Just occasional drinks. No smoking.

Good, good. Let's do a quick physical exam. I’ll listen to your heart and lungs first. So just breathe normally for me.

Good. Sounds clear. Blood pressure looks good, 118 over 76. I'll just quickly check your abdomen. Is there any tenderness here?

Um, no, feels fine.

Good, and how about here, near the incision area?

Yeah, all good there, no pain.

Excellent. Okay, last part, let's discuss your thyroid symptoms. Are you feeling unusually tired, anxious, any weight changes?

Actually, yes, I've still got a bit of weight from pregnancy. And, um, I do feel kind of tired still.

That's understandable. Have you noticed any swelling or palpitations, anything like that?

Maybe a little swelling sometimes. Not much with the palpitations, though.

Okay. Let's check some thyroid levels today, just to see where things stand. It's been a while since we checked.

Yeah, I was gonna ask about that.

Definitely. So, to summarize: we'll do a thyroid check, got irregular periods, considering IUD. Anything else you'd like to discuss today?

Oh yeah, I almost forgot—I’m still getting headaches occasionally. Maybe related to stress, I don’t know.

Got it. Are they migraines, or tension headaches, would you say?

Probably tension, I guess. Usually at the end of a stressful day.

Okay, noted. I'll add that to our follow-up list. Um, let’s get your blood drawn for thyroid testing, and we'll also check your hemoglobin levels due to your irregular periods.

Sounds good. Thanks, doctor.

You're welcome, Jamie. Always great seeing you. We'll follow up once results are in. Hang in there with the stress, okay?
