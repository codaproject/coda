"Hi there, Ms. Lopez? Hi, I'm Dr. Stevens. Nice to meet you!"

"Oh, hi Dr. Stevens, nice to meet you too."

"Welcome to the clinic. So I have your records here from Dr. Martin, but, uh, could you just start by telling me what's been going on?"

"Yeah, sure. So, well, it's kind of complicated. For a few months now, maybe like four or five months, I've had these weird abdominal pains and just, uh, di- digestive stuff. Bloating, diarrhea, sometimes constipation. It's really unpredictable."

"Okay, got it. That sounds frustrating. Can you describe the abdominal pain a little more specifically?"

"Yeah, so, it’s usually here. Sometimes it's sharp, other times it's dull. It comes and goes. It's not consistent every day, but it is pretty frequent. Like, several times a week at least."

"Right, I see. And do you notice anything specific that seems to trigger it? Ccertain foods maybe, stress, or anything else?"

"Mm, not always, but maybe stress. Food, I tried paying attention, but I couldn’t really pin down anything specific. Sometimes dairy seems worse, but not always."

"Okay, interesting. Um, any weight changes recently?"

"Uh, I've maybe lost a little unintentionally. Not a lot though, like 2kg in the last couple of months."

"Alright, good to know. Have you had fevers, night sweats, blood in the stool? Anything like that?"

"No fevers or anything. Maybe occasionally I saw blood, but not a lot. Just, like, once or twice, a small amount."

"Okay, definitely worth noting. Um, I noticed Dr. Martin ran a few labs and imaging before referring you. Did she review those results with you yet?"

"She said something about mild inflammation but didn’t give me many details. Uh, it's partly why she sent me here."

"Alright, uh, let’s look at those together. So your recent blood tests show mildly elevated CRP, uh that’s an inflammatory marker, at about 12. It's- it's usually under 5. ESR is also mildly elevated at 30. Haemoglobin slightly low at 15, uh 15? 11.5, suggesting maybe some mild anemia."

"Mm, okay. Is that…bad?"

"Well, not necessarily bad, but it does suggest something inflammatory might be going on, maybe gastrointestinal-related. Uh, we’ll have to explore more."

"Okay, good."

"Now, your stool tests were mostly negative. No parasites, infections, nothing obvious. So that's good news there."

"Yeah, Dr. Martin did say that was reassuring at least."

"Oh definitely reassuring. And your abdominal CT scan, let’s see, here it says there’s mild thickening in your, uh, terminal ileum. Uh, basically the end part of your small intestine. That can suggest inflammation, possibly Crohn’s disease, but its- its not definitive from the imaging alone."

"Oh, okay. I wasn't quite clear on that."

"Yeah, imaging helps, but we usually need a bit more to confirm. Before we go further, let’s do a quick physical exam. I'll talk through it if that's okay?"

"Yeah, that's fine."

"Great. Alright, just lay back comfortably."

"General appearance: Ms. Lopez appears comfortable, slightly anxious but cooperative. Mild pallor noted. Abdomen: soft overall but mildly tender upon p- uh palpation in the right lower quadrant—right here, right?"

"Yeah, that's exactly the spot."

"Okay, good. No masses felt, no obvious guarding. Bowel sounds normal."

"Quick check of eyes and mouth. Slight pallor in uh conjunctivae [laughter], consistent with mild anemia."

"Skin exam, no unusual rashes or lesions. That's good."

"Um, exam otherwise pretty normal. So, given your symptoms, labs, and imaging, I’m suspecting an inflammatory bowel disease, maybe Crohn’s or another similar condition, but it's still not completely clear yet."

"Okay. So, how do we figure that out?"

"Well, the best way to clarify this is usually a colonoscopy, basically a camera to directly visualise and biopsy the intestine. Have you had one before?"

"No, I've never had one. But I've heard they're not very fun."

"Yeah, prep is the toughest part honestly. The procedure itself is quick, and you’ll be asleep. But it really helps to give a definitive answer."

"Alright. Well, if you think it's important, I'll definitely do it."

"I really think it’s our next best step. We’ll biopsy any areas that look inflamed, which helps confirm or rule out specific conditions."

"Okay, that makes sense."

"Right. in the meantime, I want you to try a low-residue diet temporarily. Avoiding nuts, seeds, popcorn, raw veggies—things that might irritate your gut—just to see if symptoms calm down."

"Yeah, I've kinda been avoiding salad anyway because it made things worse."

"That's a good instinct, uh, listen to your body on that. Also, I'll prescribe you something mild to help with cramping, um, like dicycloverine, it- just as-needed until we get more answers. Uh, do you know of any medication allergies?"

"No, no allergies. And that sounds fine."

"Great. And let's get some additional labs today: iron studies, vitamin B12 levels, and maybe celiac testing, just to rule everything else out."

"Okay, that sounds good."

"How’s everything else going overall? You mentioned stress earlier, i- is that significant?"

"Yeah, work's been stressful lately. New boss, deadlines, it probably doesn't help."

"It definitely can contribute. Stress doesn't cause inflammation, but it certainly can exacerbate symptoms. Managing stress might help it a bit. Any relaxation methods you like?"

"Well, I used to do yoga, so maybe I should restart that."

"Yeah, that's a great idea. Uh, yoga, mindfulness, uh, they're definitely worth trying again."

"Yeah, I'll do that."

"Great. So, let’s summarise our plan: First, we'll schedule a colonoscopy soon to clarify your diagnosis. Second, is the low-residue diet and, uh, dicycloverine as needed for symptoms. Third, additional labs: iron, B12, celiac screening. And fourth is stress reduction with yoga or mindfulness. And we’ll review everything again after the colonoscopy."

"Okay, sounds very clear."

"Excellent. Any other questions or concerns?"

"Urm, Nope, can't think of anything else right now."

"Alright, no worries. Uh, and call us anytime if you do think of anything. I'm glad you came in today. I know this can feel overwhelming, but we’ll get you answers soon."

"Thanks, Dr. Stevens. I appreciate you being so thorough."

"Oh you're very welcome. Take care, Ms. Lopez. We’ll talk soon!"

"Thanks again, you too."
