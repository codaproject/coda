Right! Hi there! I’m Dr. Peterson. You must be Emma?

Yep, that’s me. Nice to meet you.

Nice to meet you too. So, this is your first visit with us, right? For a new patient appointment?

Yeah, its my first time here. I just moved to the area around a few months ago.

Ah. Well we’ll take good care of you. I know these longer visits can feel like a lot, but it gives us a chance to really go over everything, okay?

Okay. Sounds good.

Alright, let’s start with what brings you in today.

Um, I’ve been having really irregular periods. Sometimes I skip a couple months, and then when they come, they’re super heavy. And I have cramps that are really bad.

Got it. That does sound frustrating. Uh, when did you first notice things getting irregular?

Maybe a year ago? It got worse after I stopped taking birth control.

Okay, and how long were you on the birth control?

About five years. I stopped because my partner and I are thinking about trying for a baby soon.

Ooh, that's exciting! Alright, we’ll definitely talk more about that then. Let’s go through some history first. Do you have any past medical conditions?

Um, I have hypothyroidism. Diagnosed maybe three years ago? Which I take levothyroxine for.

Ah. Got it. Any surgeries in the past?

Just my wisdom teeth. Oh, um, and I had a laparoscopy a few years ago to check for endometriosis, but they didn’t find anything.

Ah, Brilliant. Okay. And current medications besides the levothyroxine?

Nope, just the one.

Right. Any allergies to medications that you know of?

Penicillin. I get a rash.

Right. Okay. Now let’s talk about your lifestyle a bit. Do you smoke, drink, or use any recreational drugs?

No. I drink maybe once a week, just socially, but I've never smoked.

Right. Okay. Any caffeine?

Oh yeah, coffee every morning. I try to keep it to just one cup.

That's reasonable. Uh, how about exercise and diet?

I do yoga a few times a week, and I walk my dog every day. I try to eat healthy, but you know, life happens.

Oh yeah. I totally get it. Okay, I’ll step out for a moment while you change into the gown, and we’ll do the physical exam next. Is that alright?

Okay, sounds good.

Alright, let’s start with your vitals. Blood pressure is 118 over 72. Heart rate is 76. Everything looks normal there.

On your exam, abdomen is soft, non, non-tender, no masses. Pelvic exam shows a normal uterus, no cervical motion tenderness, no adnexal masses, and we've collected a pap smear today.

Alright, you can and, uh, go ahead and change back. I’ll be right back in and we can talk through everything.

Okay.

So based on your symptoms and the history, I’d like to check some labs: hormone levels, a thyroid panel, maybe a pelvic ultrasound to see what’s going on with your ovaries.

Okay. Do you think it could be PCOS or something like that? I was reading about that.

It is possible. Irregular periods, some of the symptoms you've mentioned, those can line up with PCOS. But we’ll check labs to be sure.

Okay, thank you. That helps a lot.

Yeah, you’re welcome! We’ll figure it out together.
