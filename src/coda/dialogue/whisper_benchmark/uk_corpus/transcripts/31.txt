Hi, good afternoon, good to see you again!

Hi, good afternoon. Yeah, it's been a while.

Yeah, I think it's been about six months since I last saw you. How have you been?

Um, I've been okay. A little tired lately, I guess.

Tired? Uh, tell me more about that. What's going on?

Oh, um, you know, just not sleeping great. And feeling kind of run down.

Okay. Is it trouble falling asleep, staying asleep, or both?

Um, mostly staying asleep, I think.

Got it. Are you waking up a lot during the night?

Yeah, maybe like two or three times, I guess.

Okay, any idea what's waking you up? Bathroom visits, discomfort, or anxiety?

Mmm, mostly bathroom visits, now that you mention it.

Okay, are you drinking a lot of fluids before bed?

Not more than usual, I don't think.

Okay. Let's keep that in mind. How about your other symptoms? any headaches, dizziness, or shortness of breath?

No headaches or dizziness. Maybe just a bit out of breath sometimes, like if I['m climbing stairs.

Okay, have you noticed any swelling in your legs or feet?

No, not really.

Good. Let's go over your medications again. Are you still taking the levothyroxine?

Actually, I stopped it after my pregnancy. Was I supposed to continue?

Well, let's review that. Usually, we recheck thyroid levels after pregnancy. We'll definitely do that today.

Oh, okay, yeah, no one mentioned that before.

Yeah, it's a pretty common practice. Any other medications currently?

Just my multivitamin.

Okay, any new allergies or reactions to medications?

Nope, nothing new.

Good. Have you had any surgeries besides your c-section last year?

No, that's it.

Okay, and any new medical issues since your last visit?

Mmm, nothing I can think of.

Alright, and socially, still a nonsmoker, right?

Yeah, I've never smoked.

Great, and alcohol intake?

Maybe a glass of wine on the weekends, not much.

Okay, any drug use or recreational substances?

No, definitely not.

Good. Alright, let’s take a quick look. I'll start with listening to your heart and lungs.

Deep breath in... and out. Good. Again... Good.

Heart sounds normal. Let me check your thyroid gland quickly.

Any tenderness when I press gently?

No, feels fine.

Great. And now your ankles...no swelling here, which is good.

Okay, great.

Alright, overall, everything seems good physically. I think the next step is definitely rechecking your thyroid levels.

Okay, how soon will we know the results?

It usually just takes a couple days. I'll give you a call once they're in.

Alright, sounds good. Thanks.

Of course. Anything else on your mind today?

No, I think that's all.

Great! Good seeing you again, take care. We'll sort- talk soon.

Thanks, you too!
