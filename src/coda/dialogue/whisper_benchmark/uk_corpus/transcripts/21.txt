Hi. Good evening, Mrs. Carter, how have you been?

Oh hi, Dr. Evans, good to see you again. I've been okay, thanks.

Great, come on in, have a seat. Sorry for the wait; it's been a busy day here.

Oh, no worries.

So, tell me, how have b- things been since our last visit—still having some stomach trouble?

Yeah, it's still bothering me, though not as much. Definitely better than before.

Okay, that's good to hear. Remind me, when did these symptoms first start again?

t was about six months ago. Mostly stomach pain, nausea, and sometimes feeling bloated.

Have you noticed if anything makes it better or worse? Like, certain foods, stress, things like that?

Honestly, spicy food definitely triggers it. Coffee too, sometimes, which is tough because I love my coffee.

I get it. I really like my coffee too. Any other dietary triggers? Alcohol maybe?

Oh yeah, a glass of wine can really mess things up.

Okay, noted. Uh, have you been able to avoid these triggers?

Mostly, yes. But I slip up occasionally, though I'm trying.

That's understandable. Uh, let's review your medications quickly. You're still taking the omeprazole, right?

Uh, yes, still once a day.

Great, any other meds, supplements, or vitamins?

Just vitamin D and occasionally ibuprofen for headaches.

Okay, good to know. Remind me, do you have any medication allergies?

Penicillin gives, gives me hives.

Right, that's important. Let's quickly touch base about your past medical history. Are you still dealing with hypertension?

Yeah, but it's controlled now with medication.

Excellent. Any surgeries since last time, or anything new come up?

Nope, nothing new.

Perfect. Let's talk briefly about your social history again. Are you still working from home?

Yeah, I'm still remote.

Okay, and smoking, alcohol, anything else?

I don't smoke. Alcohol is minimal, mostly socially.

Got it, that's great. Alright, let's do a quick physical exam. If you wouldn't mind hopping up on the exam table here?

Sure, no problem.

Thanks. Uh, let me start by just checking your heart and lungs quickly, if you can take some deep breaths for me.

Sounds clear, very good. Okay, I'm going to gently press around your stomach now. Tell me if anything hurts.

Okay.

Any tenderness here?

No, that's okay.

What about over here?

Ahh, yeah, a little sensitive there.

Sorry about that. This is right around where you described before.

Yeah, exactly.

Okay. It's good to confirm. Uh, let's sit back up. Based on everything we've talked about, this still sounds a lot like gastritis, possibly aggravated by diet.

Oh okay, that's what we thought last time.

Yeah, and sometimes these things take longer to improve completely. I'd like you to keep going with the em- omeprazole and really try and avoid those triggers.

Okay, I'll definitely try harder.

That's great. Any questions for me right now?

Umm, just wondering—will I need any other tests, or are we good for now?

At this point, I think we can hold off on more tests unless symptoms get worse.

Okay. Sounds good.

Great, let's check in again in about three months to see how things are going.

Perfect, thanks.

You're welcome. Always great seeing you and have a nice day.

You too, take care.

Thanks, you too.
