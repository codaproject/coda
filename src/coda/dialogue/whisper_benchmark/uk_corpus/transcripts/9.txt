"Hi, Sarah! Come on in, how are you doing today?"

"Dr. Ramirez! Yeah, I'm, I'm… well, I'm okay. A little stressed, I guess."

"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. What's going on?"

"Well, the bleeding hasn't really stopped, and the cramps are still pretty bad. And, you know, the nausea? It's just… constant."

"Okay, let's take this one step at a time. So, the bleeding. Still heavy, or…?"

"It's not as heavy as it was initially, but it's definitely not spotting. It’s, it's a steady flow. And, like, I’m changing pads every few hours."

"Okay, that's important to note. And the cramps? Where are they located, and how would you rate the pain?"

"Mostly in my lower abdomen. Like, right in the middle. And on a scale of one to ten, I’d say… a solid seven. Some days, an eight."

"Ouch. That's significant. And the nau- nausea? Any vomiting?"

"No, thankfully no vomiting. Just… constant nausea. Like, I feel queasy all the time. And I’m, I'm so tired. I can barely get through the day."

"Uh, let’s review your medication. You're still on the progesterone, right? And the pain medication?"

"Yeah, I'm taking everything as prescribed. I even set alarms so I don’t forget."

"Good. And how about your diet? Are you eating okay?"

"I'm trying to. But with the nausea, it's hard. I’m mostly sticking to crackers and ginger ale. And, you know, whatever my husband can manage to cook."

"Okay. We need to make sure you're getting enough nutrients. We might need to consider something for the nausea if it's interfering with your eating. And, how’s your sleep? I know you mentioned fatigue."

"Oh, it's terrible. I wake up several times a night. Either from the cramps or… just because I can’t get comfortable. And I'm just… worried."

"I understand. This is a lot to deal with. Let’s do a quick pelvic exam, just to check things out. And we need to repeat the ultrasound, too, to see if there's any change in the… the size of the fibroid."

"Okay, that, that sounds good. I just want to know what’s going on."

"Of course. And we should also check your haemoglobin levels. The prolonged bleeding could be causing anaemia. And how are your bowel movements? Any changes there?"

"Uh, kind of. I’ve been… constipated. I think. Uh, probably from the pain medication."

"Okay, we’ll address that too. We can provi- uh, prescribe something to help with the constipation. We don’t want you to be uncomfortable. And, you know, it can make the cramps worse."

"Oh, I, I didn’t know that."

"Yes, everything is connected. Now, are you still having those hot flashes? We talked about that last time, right?"

"Oh, yes! They're still happening. Especially at night. And I wake up drenched in sweat. It’s awful."

"Okay. We can talk about some hormone replacement therapy options, or some other medications to help with those symptoms. We need to get you some relief. And how are you feeling emotionally? This can be really difficult."

"It is. I’m… I’m just so overwhelmed. And I feel like I'm constantly complaining. My husband is great, but… I feel like a burden."

"You are not a burden, Sarah. This is a medical issue, and we’re going to get through this together. We can also discuss some counseling options, if you think that would be helpful. It’s important to take care of your mental health as well as your physical health."

"Yeah, that, that would be nice. I, I think I would like that."

"Great. We'll get that set up for you. Now, let’s go over the ultrasound results from last week. The fibroid has grown slightly, but it’s still within the range we discussed. We need to monitor it closely. And the blood work showed some mild anaemia, as we suspected."

"Okay."

"I’m going to adjust your pain medication and give you something for the nausea and constipation. We’ll also schedule the repeat ultrasound and blood work for next week. And we need to discuss the hot flashes in more detail. We have several options. We can also talk about a D&C procedure if the bleeding continues. We want to stop the bleeding, and relieve the pain."

"A D&C? Okay… I’m, I'm a little nervous about that."

"It’s a common procedure, and we can discuss all the risks and benefits. We’ll make sure you’re comfortable with whatever decision we make. And we'll get you some resources for counseling."

"Okay, thank you, Dr. Ramirez. I, I really appreciate you listening."

"Of course, Sarah. That’s what I’m here for. We’ll get this sorted out. My nurse will schedule your appointments and give you the prescriptions. And please, don’t hesitate to call if you have any con- questions or concerns."
