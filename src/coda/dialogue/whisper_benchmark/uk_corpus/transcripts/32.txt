Good morning, I'm Dr Patel. I’ll be your primary care provider today. How are you feeling?

Morning, Doctor. Uh, not great, honestly. That’s why I’m here.

I understand. Well, we’ll take our time and go through everything. Is this your first time at our clinic?

Yeah, first time. I just moved here a couple months ago.

Welcome to the area. Let’s start with what’s been going on lately. What brings you in today?

Um, I’ve been feeling really run down. Tired all the time, headaches, my joints ache. And my blood pressure’s been weird.

Okay, when did these symptoms start?

I’d say about... maybe three months ago? It’s been slowly getting worse.

Have you had any fevers, chills, or recent illnesses?

No fevers. I had a cold a while back but nothing major.

Any weight changes?

Yeah, I’ve gained about 6.8kg. I haven’t changed my diet or anything.

Alright. Let's back up a bit. Do you have any chronic medical conditions?

Yeah, I’ve got hypothyroidism, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension.

And are you currently taking medications for those?

I take levothyroxine, metformin, and lisinopril.

Do you know the dosages?

Yeah, the levothyroxine is 75mcg, metformin 1000mg twice a day, and the lisinopril I think is 20mg?

Got it. Any issues with the medications? Side effects, missed doses?

Sometimes I miss the evening metformin if I’m not home. Otherwise, I try to take everything.

Okay. Any allergies to medications or foods?

Uh, yeah I'm allergic to blueberries.

Any past surgeries?

Just my gallbladder out in 2012.

And any hospitalisations other than for that surgery?

No.

Can you tell me a bit about your social history? Do you smoke or drink?

No smoking. I don't really drink, you know, I try and avoid it. Sometimes, I have a drink at a special occasion or something. But not, you know, on a regular basis.

And any drug use?

Oh no, nothing like that.

What do you do for work?

I work in IT. Sit at a desk most of the day.

Okay. Do you live alone?

No, with my husband and our two kids.

Great, thank you. Now, let’s do a quick review of systems to make sure we’re not missing anything.

Any chest pain, palpitations, or shortness of breath?

Sometimes I get out of breath going upstairs, but no chest pain.

How about GI issues? Nausea, constipation, diarrhea?

Constipation, yeah. That's pretty regular for me.

Any urinary issues? Burning, frequency, blood?

Not really. Maybe I go a lot, but I figured that’s from the metformin.

It could be. Any numbness, tingling, or weakness?

My hands get tingly sometimes when I wake up.

Okay, noted. And how’s your mood? Any depression or anxiety?

I’ve been feeling kind of low, like, unmotivated. But no panic or anything.

Thank you for sharing that. Let’s move on to the physical exam now. I’ll be checking your vitals and doing a head-to-toe assessment.

Blood pressure is 148/92. Pulse is 88. Temperature is normal. Oxygen saturation 98%.

On exam, thyroid is not enlarged. No neck masses.

Heart sounds regular, no murmurs. Lungs clear to auscultation.

Abdomen soft, non-tender. No hepatosplenomegaly.

Reflexes slightly diminished in lower extremities. Mild, uh, pedal oedema.

Skin dry. No rashes noted.

Based on today’s findings, I suspect your thyroid might be under-controlled, and your blood pressure could use some adjustment.

Yeah, I figured something was off. I haven’t felt like myself.

We’ll do some bloodwork today—TSH, CMP, CBC, A1C, lipid panel. Is there anything else bothering you?

My knees hurt when I walk, but I thought that was just age.

Hm, it could be osteoarthritis. We’ll get X-rays and maybe refer to ortho if needed.

I’m also going to adjust your lisinopril to 40mg and check your thyroid labs before changing the levothyroxine.

We’ll schedule a follow-up in two weeks to go over results. Does that sound good?

Yeah, thank you. That sounds good.

Of course. You’re doing the right thing by coming in. We’ll get to the bottom of this.
