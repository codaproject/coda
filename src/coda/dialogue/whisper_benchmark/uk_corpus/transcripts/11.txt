"So, good morning, Ms. Harrison. Please come in."

"Hi, Dr. Patel."

"How have you been since our last appointment?"

"It's been complicated. The symptoms are unpredictable."

"Well, let's go through your recent test results. Your colonoscopy and endoscopy results are back."

"I'm worried."

"Your endoscopy showed some inflammation in the small intestine. The biopsies reveal signs consistent with Crohn's disease progression."

"What does that mean exactly?"

"It means the inflammation is more active than in our previous assessment. Your inflammation markers are elevated."

"So it's getting worse?"

"Not necessarily worse, but definitely more complex. Your calprotectin levels are significantly high, indicating ongoing intestinal inflammation."

"I've been having these terrible stomach cramps. And the bathroom trips are exhausting."

"Well, tell me more about the frequency and severity of these symptoms."

"Some days, I'm running to the bathroom 8-10 times. Mostly in the morning. And the pain...it's sharp. Right here."

"Have you been tracking your diet like we discussed?"

"I tried. But it's hard. Everything seems to trigger something."

"Hmm. Your recent imaging studies show some slight narrowing in the small intestine. We're going to need to adjust your treatment approach."

"What does that mean?"

"It means we'll modify your medication. Increase the immunosuppressant dosage. And I want to start you on a new biologic therapy."

"More medications? I'm already taking so many."

"I understand. But this combination should help manage the inflammation more effectively. We'll also need to do some additional blood work to monitor your response."

"It's just so overwhelming."

"Chronic conditions are challenging. But we have multiple strategies. Your recent weight loss concerns me though. You've lost about 5kg in two months."

"I know. I'm not really hungry. Nothing tastes good."

"We'll connect you with a nutritionist. There's a specialised diet for inflammatory bowel conditions to ensure you're getting proper nutrish- nutrients."

"So our new plan: we're going to start new biologic medication, increase current immunosuppressant dosage, get a nutritional consultation, weekly blood work for the next month, a follow-up appointment in four weeks, and we'll consider additional imaging if symptoms persist."

"That sounds a lot."

"We'll take it step by step. Your health is our priority."

"Okay."

"Any questions?"

"Will I ever feel normal again?"

"We're working to get you as close to normal as possible. Management is key."

"Thank you, Doctor."
