"Good morning, Ms. Thompson. I'm Dr. Garcia. Please have a seat."

"Thank you, Doctor."

"So this is a new patient visit, and I understand you've been referred to our oncology department. Before we dive into specifics, would you mind if I take some comprehensive notes?"

"Of course, go ahead."

"Right, let's start with your current medications. Could you walk me through what you're taking?"

"Well, let's see... I'm on metformin for diabetes. And, lisinopril for blood pressure. And I take a daily multivitamin."

"Any other supplements or over-the-counter medications?"

"Sometimes I take ibuprofen for my arthritis. When it flares up."

"Okay, good to know. And allergies?"

"Penicillin. I break out in a terrible rash."

"Okay. Penicillin allergy noted. Any other medication allergies?"

"No, not that I'm aware of."

"Okay. Let's discuss your social history. Can you tell me about your work, living situation, support system?"

"Um, I'm retired. I worked as a high school teacher for 35 years. I live alone, but my daughter lives nearby and she helps me out."

"Do you use tobacco, alcohol, or recreational drugs?"

"I quit smoking about ten years ago. Used to be a pack a day. I have a glass of wine maybe... twice a week? No drugs."

"Past smoker. Light alcohol use. Can you tell me about your past medical history?"

"It's complicated. I've had type 2 diabetes for about 15 years. Hypertension. Had a hip replacement in 2018. Oh, and I had a bout of pneumonia two years ago."

"Okay. Any surgeries besides the hip replacement?"

"Um, gallbladder removal in 2010, but nothing major."

"Okay, um, family medical history?"

"My mother had breast cancer. My father died of heart disease. And my sister has lupus."

"Okay. Um, I'm going to do a compre- comprehensive review of systems. Uh, bear with me. Um, any recent changes in weight?"

"I've lost about 5kg without trying. Which is...unusual for me."

"Okay. Unintentional weight loss can be significant. Uh, any appetite changes?"

"I'm less hungry. Food just doesn't taste the same."

"Right. Um, energy levels?"

"I'm tired. So tired. I used to be so active."

"Any pain?"

"Lower back. Its a constant ache. Worse some days."

"I'm going to perform a physical examination now. Uh, please let me know if anything causes discomfort."

"Okay."

"So, heart sounds regular. Breath sounds...slightly diminished in the lower right lobe."

"Er, is something wrong?"

"Just gathering information. Er, any swelling in your legs? Hmm..."

"What is it?"

"I'd like to discuss some lab results and imaging studies we've ordered. Er, Your CBC shows some irregularities. Urm, your white blood cell count is elevated."

"Okay. So what does that mean?"

"It could indicate several things. Erm, we'll need additional tests. Your CT scan showed a suspicious nodule in the right lung. Er, we'll need a biopsy to determine its nature."

"Cancer?"

"We're not jumping to conclusions. But we need to be thorough. I'm ordering a PET scan, additional blood work, and we'll schedule a lung biopsy."

"Okay."

"Our plan is comprehensive. We'll reconvene in two weeks to review everything."

"Thank you, Doctor."

"Do you have any questions?"

"Just... will I be okay?"

"We're going to be very systematic in our approach. One step at a time."
