"Good morning, Mr. Johnson. I'm Dr. Nguyen. It’s a pleasure to meet you today."

"Good morning, Dr. Nguyen. Pleasure to meet you, too."

"Since you’re new to our oncology clinic, we’ll take some time to thoroughly discuss your medical history, medications, and recent test results. Is that alright with you?"

"Yes, that's perfectly fine."

"Great. First, can you confirm your date of birth for me, please?"

"Um, it's August 10th, 1960."

"Thank you. And, before we begin, can you briefly describe your understanding of why you were referred to oncology?"

"Uh, sure. My primary care Dr. Anderson, said my blood work showed some abnormalities. Um… something about elevated white cells, I believe."

"Yeah, that's right. We'll review that in detail shortly. Let's just confirm your current medications. Are you currently taking any prescription medications?"

"Yeah, I take Metformin 500 milligrams twice a day for diabetes. And, um, Lisinopril…20 milligrams daily for my blood pressure."

"Okay, any over-the-counter medications or supplements you take regularly?"

"Not really. Although, sometimes Panadol for headaches, but not often."

"Okay. Thank you. Do you have any known medication allergies to medication or any sensitivities?"

"Yes. Penicillin, I had a rash as a kid."

"Alright, penicillin allergy—rash. Noted. Now, regarding your past medical history, you mentioned diabetes and hypertension. Any other significant medical history, hospitalisations, or any surgeries?"

"Uh…let’s see. Diabetes, high blood pressure. Um, I had a hernia surgery about ten years ago, but nothing recent."

"Okay. Any history of cancer, cancer in yourself previously?"

"No, never."

"Alright. Moving on to family history—any cancers or blood disorders in immediate family members?"

"My mother had breast cancer at age 75, but that's the only one I know about."

"Okay, mother had breast cancer at 75. No other cancers or blood conditions?"

"No, none that I'm aware of."

"Thank you. Now briefly, social history: do you currently smoke or use tobacco products?"

"No, I've never smoked."

"Okay, Alcohol use?"

"Occasionally, maybe one glass of wine per week socially."

"Okay, any recreational drug use currently or in the past?"

"No, none."

"Great. Uh, what's your occupation?"

"I’m a retired school teacher."

"Thank you. Let’s briefly review your current symptoms, just a quick check: Any fatigue or unexplained weight loss recently?"

"Maybe some fatigue, yes. No weight loss though."

"Okay. Fever or night sweats?"

"No, nothing like that."

"Bleeding or bruising easily?"

"Not that I've noticed."

"Okay, good. Uh, let’s perform a brief physical examination now. Uh, I’ll narrate as I go, if that's alright."

"Yes, that's fine."

"Okay. General exam: Mr. Johnson appears well-nourished, alert, cooperative, no acute distress noted. Vital signs today—blood pressure 134 over 82, heart rate 74, normal respiratory rate. No fever."

"Head and neck: Pupils equal, reactive. Oral mucosa normal, no lesions. Neck supple, no, uh, lymphadenopathy pala- palpable.[laughter]"

"Chest: Clear to auscultation bilatery- bilaterally, no abnormal breath sounds."

"Uh. Heart: Regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs."

"Abdomen: Soft, non-tender, bowel sounds normal. No palpable masses or hepatosplenomegaly."

"Uh, extremities: No edema, pulses palpable bilatery- bilaterally. Skin examination normal, no unusual bruising or, um, petechiae noted."

"Uh, physical exam appears completely normal, Mr. Johnson."

"Good to hear, thank you."

"Of course. Now, let’s move on to reviewing your lab results. As you mentioned earlier, your white blood cell count was elevated—specifically, it was, um, 14,500. It's usually under 11,000."

"Yes, Dr. Anderson mentioned that briefly."

"Your differential count shows elevated lymphocytes—um, specifically uh, lympho- um, lymphocytosis. Your hemoglobin and platelets are within normal limits, though."

"Well, what does that mean exactly?"

"Thats a good question. Elevated lymphocytes can sometimes indicate a condition called Chronic Lymphocytic uh, l-l- Leukemia—or CLL—especially given your age and presentation. It’s usually slow-progressing and often requires just monitoring initially."

"Oh, okay…is it serious?"

"Well, CLL is considered a form of blood cancer, but it's typically manageable. Often, patients don’t require treatment right away. We’ll perform additional testing to confirm the diagnosis."

"Alright."

"In fact, Dr. Anderson had al- also ordered a peripheral blood smear which shows typical small lymphocytes consistent with CLL. To be thorough, I'd like to run some specialised tests, specifically flow cytometry, which helps confirm the diagnosis and subtype."

"That sounds okay."

"Also, we’ll perform imaging—likely a CT scan—to ensure there's no enlarged lymph nodes or organ involvement."

"Okay, um—are there any risks with the CT scan?"

"Uh, only minimal. Uh, ,ainly radiation exposure, but it's considered low-risk, and the benefits in confirming your condition outweigh those minimal risks."

"Alright."

"Excellent. So, let me summarise today’s care plan: We suspect, uh, Chronic, uh, l- Lymphocytic Leukemia based on your labs. Two—we'll order specialised blood tests (flow cytometry) to confirm this clearly. Three—a CT scan to evaluate lymph nodes and organ involvement. And four—once results are available, we'll meet again to discuss findings clearly and plan next steps, uh, possibly just careful observation."

"That sounds clear to me."

"Good. Before we finish, do you have any further questions or concerns at this time?"

"Uh…yeah, actually—should I be doing anything differently, like lifestyle-wise?"

"Maintain a healthy lifestyle, ba- balanced diet, regular exercise—these remain beneficial. Ensure regular follow-ups. A- At this point, no major restrictions or changes are required."

"Okay, that's good to know."

"Any additional questions, Mr. Johnson?"

"Um…no, I think you've covered everything clearly."

"Wonderful. If you think of anything else, please don't hesitate to reach out. We'll schedule your follow-up once the additional tests are complete."

"Thank you, Dr. Nguyen. I really appreciate your thoroughness."

"My pleasure. It was a pleasure meeting you today. Take care, and we'll speak again soon."

"Thanks again. Have a good day."

"You as well."
