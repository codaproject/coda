"Hi, Alex. Come on in, have a seat. How are you doing today?"

"Hey, Dr. Smith. Uh… I don't know. It's been… up and down, I guess."

"Okay. Up and down. Uh, can you elaborate on that a bit? What's been going on?"

"Well, the anxiety's been better, mostly. The meds seem to be helping with that. But the, uh, the other stuff, the mood swings, they're still happening. And my sleep is still all over the place."

"Right, we talked about this, uh, last time. The mood swings. Are they still as intense? And how long do they last?"

"Yeah, they're still pretty intense. Like, one minute I'm fine, the next I'm- I'm just angry or really sad. And it can last for hours, sometimes days. I think it's hard to tell."

"Okay, and the sleep? Are you still waking up in the middle of the night?"

"Yeah, and sometimes I can't fall asleep at all. And then other nights, I sleep for like, twelve hours. It's messed up."

"Okay. And are you still experiencing any of the- the racing thoughts? Or any unusual energy levels?"

"The racing thoughts are less, I think. But the energy, sometimes I feel like I can do anything. And then other times, I can barely even get out of bed."

"Oh okay. So let's talk about the medication. You're still on the sertraline for anxiety and the lamotrigine for the mood stabilisation, right?"

"Yeah [laughter], that’s right."

"And are you taking them as prescribed?"

"Most of the time. Uh, sometimes, I forget, uh, at night. But I try to take it in the morning."

"Okay, it's important to take it consistently, Alex. It helps to keep the levels stable in your system. Now, let's do a quick mental status exam. How are you feeling right now? Can you tell me your name, where you are, and the date?"

"Uh, I'm Alex. I'm at the doctor's office. And it's Tuesday, I think?"

"Okay, good. And can you tell me about your mood today? How would you describe it?"

"Kind of flat, I guess. A little tired. And a little irritated."

"Okay. And are you experiencing any unusual thoughts? Or any hallucinations or delusions?"

"No, no, nothing like that. Just the usual stuff. The worrying, the mood swings."

"Okay. I'm going to check your reflexes and do a quick neurological exam. Reflexes are normal. Gait is normal. Speech is normal. No tremors noted. Cranial nerves intact."

"Okay, everything seems normal physically. Now, let's talk about those labs we did last month. Your thyroid levels are still within normal range, which is good. And your vitamin D is a little low. We should address that."

"Oh, okay. So what does that mean?"

"Well low vitamin D can sometimes affect mood and energy levels. I'm going to prescribe a vitamin D supplement. We’ll recheck it in a few months. And, we also did that complete metabolic panel, and everything else was normal."

"Now, regarding the mood swings. It sounds like the lamotrigine might not be fully effective yet. It can take some time to reach therapeutic levels. We could consider adjusting the dosage, or adding another medication just to help with the mood stabilisation. But, we need to be careful, because of the sleep issues."

"So, more meds?"

"Possibly. We need to find the right balance. And we need to address the sleep. We could try a low dose of something to help you sleep, but we need to be careful not to make you too drowsy during the day. We also need to consider a sleep study, if this continues."

"A sleep study? [cough] Sorry. What's that?"

"It's a test where we monitor your sleep overnight. It can help us identify any underlying sleep disorders that might be contributing to your sleep problems. We also need to discuss some sleep hygiene techniques. Like, regular sleep schedule, no screen time before bed, that kind of thing."

"Okay, I can try that."

"Good. Um, I’m also going to recommend we continue with the therapy sessions. Imp- It's important to have that support system while we're adjusting your medications. And we can also discuss some cognitive behavioral therapy techniques to help manage the mood swings."

"Okay. I am still going to therapy."

"Oh that's great. So, I’m going to increase your lamotrigine dosage slightly. And I’m prescribing a vitamin D supplement. We’ll discuss the sleep hygiene, and I’ll give you a referral for a sleep study if we need it. We’ll see you back in a month to reassess. How does that sound?"

"Okay. Thank you, Dr. Smith."

"You’re welcome, Alex. We’ll get this figured out. My nurse will give you the prescriptions and schedule your next appointments."
