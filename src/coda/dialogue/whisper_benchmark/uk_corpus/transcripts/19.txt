"Uh, good afternoon, Mr. Rodriguez. Come in and have a seat."

"Hello, Dr. Chen."

"Uh, how have you been feeling since our last visit?"

"Erm. Okay, I guess. Some good days, some not so good."

"Let's review your recent lab work and imaging studies. Uh, your latest blood work shows some interesting changes."

"Uh, is that good or bad?"

"Your CEA marker has decreased slightly. That's generally a positive sign. Urm, your white blood cell count is stabilising."

"What does that mean exactly?"

"It suggests the current treatment is having some effect. Uh, the chemotherapy appears to be managing the cancer's progression."

"Small victories, right?"

"Precisely. Now, I want to discuss your recent PET scan. Erm, here's what we- we're seeing."

"I never understand these images."

"Well the primary tumor site shows minimal change. The secondary nodules we were monitoring have not increased in size."

"So, no spreading?"

"That's right. The stability is encouraging. We'll continue the current treatment protocol."

"Another round of chemo..."

"Yeah. How are you managing the side effects?"

"I'm tired. Nauseous sometimes. But my wife helps. She's been...  incredible."

"Support systems are crucial. Are you able to maintain some physical activity?"

"Short walks. Not like before. I used to run marathons."

"Any new symptoms I should know about?"

"Some chest pain. Right side. It comes and goes."

"We'll want to monitor that. Could be treatment-related or something we need to investigate further."

"Should I be worried?"

"Not necessarily. But we'll do a follow-up chest X-ray to be certain."

"Our plan for the next month: continue current chemotherapy regimen, uh, repeat blood work in 2 weeks, chest x-ray next week, and schedule a follow up appointment in one month."

"Okay. That sounds... manageable."

"Any questions for me today?"

"Just... how am I doing?"

"Being cautiously optimistic. The cancer is stable. We're manager- managing it effectively."

"That's something, I guess."

"Yeah. We'll keep fighting it together."

"Thank you, Doctor."
