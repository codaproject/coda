Good morning, I'm Dr. Thompson. How can I help you today?

Uh, good morning doctor. I was referred here by my primary care because of, um, a lump in my neck.

Oh, I see. How long have you noticed the lump?

About three months or so. It's slowly been getting bigger.

Any pain or discomfort associated with it?

It's not really painful, just feels uncomfortable sometimes, like pressure.

Have you noticed any changes in your voice, like hoarseness?

A little hoarse sometimes, yeah.

Any trouble swallowing or breathing difficulties?

No problems breathing, but sometimes swallowing is, um, slightly uncomfortable.

Right. Any weight changes recently?

I think I've lost about 2kg without trying.

Any other symptoms, like night sweats, fever, or fatigue?

I'm definitely more tired than usual, but no fevers or sweats.

Let's go over your medical history. Any medical problems I should know about?

I have hypertension and diabetes.

What medications are you currently taking for these medi- uh, those conditions?

Metformin and, um, Lisinopril.

Any surgeries in the past?

Just my wisdom teeth removed when I was 20.

Okay. Do you have any allergies?

Um, you mean like, medications or just any allergy?

Any allergies.

Oh, yeah I'm allergic to shellfish.

Okay. And no allergies to medications? 

No, not - not that I know.

Alright, noted. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use recreational drugs?

I smoked years ago but quit about 10 years ago. I drink socially, but no drugs.

Okay. Any family history of cancer or thyroid issues?

My aunt had thyroid cancer, but she's doing okay now.

Oh, that's great. Let's proceed with a quick physical exam. I'll check your neck first, please lift your chin.

Like this?

Yes, exactly. The lump feels firm, and I can feel a couple of enlarged lymph nodes here. Any tenderness?

Not really tender, just pressure.

Alright, breathe normally. I'll listen to your heart and lungs now. Good.

Please open your mouth wide. Good. Now swallow for me.

I can see some slight asymmetry. Let's check your pulse now. Okay, that's good.

Your pulse rate is normal. I'll quickly check your abdomen. Lie back please.

Okay.

No issues there. You can sit up now.

Thanks.

Based on the examination, we need to run some tests, including an ultrasound of your thyroid and some blood tests.

Okay. Should I be worried?

At this point, it's hard to say. The ultrasound and tests will help us u- understand better. Any other questions?

No, that's all for now.

Okay, let's schedule those tests and I'll see you once we have those results.

Thank you.

You're welcome. Take care and I'll see you soon.
