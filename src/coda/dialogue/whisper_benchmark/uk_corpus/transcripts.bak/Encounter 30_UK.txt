Good morning, Ms Adams. I'm Dr Carter, one of the cardiologists here. How are you today?

Um, good morning. I'm doing okay, I guess.

Good to hear. So, I see this is your first time visiting our cardiology clinic. Can you tell me a bit about what's bringing you here today?

Yeah, I've been having some chest pains, sort of a pressure feeling for the past few weeks, mostly when I'm climbing stairs or walking really fast.

I see. And how long does the pain usually last?

Not very long, maybe a couple minutes at most. It goes away if I sit down or rest.

Alright. Have you experienced any shortness of breath, dizziness, or nausea along with the chest pain?

Um, shortness of breath sometimes, yeah, but no dizziness or nausea.

Okay, and have you noticed any patterns, such as more frequent episodes at certain times of the day?

No, it's just whenever I'm active.

Understood. Let's go over your medical history quickly. Any previous heart problems, high blood pressure, diabetes?

I have high blood pressure, I was diagnosed about five years ago. But no diabetes or heart problems.

Any surgeries in the past?

Uh, yeah. I had my gallbladder removed in 2018.

Okay. Are you currently on any medications for your blood pressure?

Yeah, um, lisinopril, 10mg once a day.

Any allergies to medications?

No, not that I'm aware of.

Do you smoke or consume alcohol regularly?

No smoking. I drink every now and again, you know, just normal stuff. Not like, every day. 

Okay, any family history of heart disease or strokes?

Yeah my dad had a heart attack at 60, and I think my mum has high blood pressure.

Thank you, that's helpful. Let's proceed to the physical examination. I'm going to listen to your heart and lungs first.

Okay.

Take a deep breath for me. And again. 

Your lungs sound clear. Now let's listen to your heart.

Hmm... Okay, sounds like a mild murmur, possibly benign. Has anyone ever mentioned that before?

No, I've never heard about it.

Alright, its not necessarily concerning but we'll check it further. Could you lie back, please?

Sure.

I'm checking your pulses now. All normal. Let's check your ankles for swelling.

Okay.

Good, no swelling or oedema. Have you noticed any swelling at home?

No, haven't noticed.

Alright, you can sit up now. Based on what you're describing, we should run some tests, specifically an ECG and a stress test, to evaluate your chest pain more clearly.

Oh. Is- is this serious?

I can't say for sure yet, but it does sound like it could be angina, which is chest pain due to decreased blood flow to the heart. The tests will clarify that.

Oh, okay...

Do you have any questions or concerns about these tests?

No, I just, I just want to get it checked out.

Absolutely, it's good you're addressing it early. My nurse will schedule the tests, and we'll follow up once we have results.

Okay, thank you.

You're welcome, Ms Adams. We'll take good care of you.
