Transcripted Line

Good afternoon, Mr. Jensen. How are you today?

Oh, hi, Dr. Martin... I've been better, honestly.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Tell me what's been going on.

Well, uh, the depression feels worse again. I'm just... struggling.

Can you describe how it's worse compared to last month?

I guess it's, uh, I'm feeling hopeless, again, you know? I'm sleeping all day.

Have you noticed changes in your appetite or concentration?

Yeah, my appetite's kinda disappeared, I, I barely eat once a day now.

And your concentration?

It's terrible. I can't read, I can't watch TV, nothing sticks.

Have you had any thoughts about harming yourself or others?

Honestly, I've thought about hurting myself lately, nothing serious but... thoughts are there.

I'm glad you're sharing. Have you made any plans or preparations?

No, no plans, just fleeting thoughts.

Okay. Uh, let's check in on medications. You're currently on sertraline, correct?

Yeah, 100mg.

Are you experiencing any side effects from it?

Not really, no side effects.

And are you still taking lorazepam for anxiety as needed?

I take it maybe two times a week when anxiety gets really bad.

Any new medications from other providers?

Um, I started taking blood pressure meds. Something... lisinopril?

Good to know. And what dosage are you on?

10mg daily.

Have there been any surgeries or hospitalisations since our last visit?

No, nothing.

And any allergies we should update?

No, none.

Alright, thank you. Let's go uh, um... Let's through your past medical history quickly. Depression, anxiety, and hypertension now, correct?

Yeah, that's correct.

And your social history? You're still living alone?

Yes, living alone. My sister visits occasionally though.

Is there any alcohol or drug use?

Uh, just occasional drinking, no drugs.

How often and how much alcohol?

Maybe a couple of beers a week, nothing much.

Alright. How about tobacco?

No, no smoking, I never have.

Good. Any issues with your sleep besides the depression?

I'm waking up a lot, uh, trouble staying asleep.

Okay, we'll address that shortly. I'd like to do a brief physical exam now.

Okay, sure.

[clears throat] Vitals look good, blood pressure slightly elevated at 140/90, pulse is 80.

Eyes normal. Let me check your neck...no thyroid enlargement.

Heart sounds normal, no murmurs. Breathing clear, lungs sound good.

Abdomen soft, non-tender. Any tenderness here?

No, nothing there.

Okay. Reflexes normal, strength good. Physically you look okay.

[clears throat] Coming back to your mood. Have you noticed triggers for worsening depression?

Not really, it's just random, or maybe isolation. I'm, I'm unsure.

Been able to follow through with therapy?

No, I've, I've missed some sessions. I've been feeling too down to attend.

I'd strongly encourage getting back into regular therapy. It does help. 

Yeah, I know. I, I will try.

Considering your symptoms, let's increase the sertraline to 150mg. How does that sound?

I'm okay with trying that.

Great. Let's meet again in three weeks to reassess. You can call if things worsen.

Okay, I will. Thanks, Dr. Martin.

You're welcome. Take care, Mr. Jensen.
