Transcripted Line

Good morning, Mr. Johnson, nice to see you again. How are you doing today?

Good morning, doctor. Well, not great honestly. I've had a rough couple of weeks.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Let's discuss what's been going on. Could you tell me more?

Yeah, I've been experiencing more stomach pain lately. It's gotten worse, especially after meals.

Have you noticed if anything in particular triggers or exacerbates this pain?

Mostly greasy or spicy food, I guess. But recently, it's been almost everything.

How would you describe the pain? Is it sharp, dull, or burning?

It's mostly a sharp pain, right here.

Okay. On a scale from one to ten, how severe would you rate this pain typically?

Lately, it's been around an 8. Pretty severe.

Have you experienced naus- nausea or vomiting along with the pain?

Nausea, yes. But no vomiting, thankfully.

Okay. Any change in bowel habits recently? Diarrhea or constipation?

I've been constipated more often. It's uncomfortable.

Understood. Have you noticed blood in your stool or any dark, tarry stools?

Actually, yes. A couple times it seemed dark, not sure if it's blood though.

That's important to note. Um, how about your appetite and weight—any recent changes?

I've lost some weight without trying, maybe around 5kg in the past two months.

I see. Let's quickly review your medical history. Any updates to your conditions?

No, still dealing with my diabetes and hypertension. Nothing new.

Are you taking your medications regularly? Metformin and Lisinopril?

Yeah, taking them as prescribed.

Okay. Have you had any new surgeries or hospitalisations since our last visit?

No surgeries, but I did go to A&E last month because of severe stomach pain.

Were there any findings?

They ran some tests and said something about possible gastritis, gave me some medicine.

Did they prescribe you something specific, like omeprazole or another antacid?

Yeah, omeprazole. I've been taking it, but honestly, it's not helping much.

Alright, noted. Um, any medication allergies we should update?

No new allergies.

Thanks for confirming. How about your social habits—any changes in smoking or alcohol?

Still smoke occasionally. I'm trying to quit. Alcohol only socially, maybe once a week.

Okay. Let’s do a physical exam to get a clearer picture. 

Tell me if this hurts when I press.

Ouch, yes—that spot definitely hurts.

Sorry about that. Definitely tender in the, um, epigastrium.

Bowel sounds seem a bit decreased.

Is that concerning?

It's noteworthy, but we'll evaluate further. Deep breath now.

Lungs sound clear. Any shortness of breath lately?

No, breathing's been fine.

Okay. Heart rate slightly elevated. Any chest pain or palpitations recently?

No, nothing like that.

Okay. Blood pressure slightly elevated today, 145 over 90.

Have you noticed headaches or dizziness?

Occasionally, but nothing too severe.

We'll keep monitoring that.

Given your symptoms and the weight loss, I think further investigations are necessary.

Um, what kind of tests are you thinking about?

I'd recommend an- an upper end- endoscopy and possibly some imaging, like a CT scan.

Is an endoscopy painful?

Oh you’ll be sedated for it, so you shouldn’t feel discomfort during the procedure.

Alright, well, if you think it's needed.

I do, especially to rule out ulcers or more serious conditions.

You don't think it could be cancer, do you?

I understand your concern. We need these tests to accurately determine what's going on.

Let's schedule these tests urgently and plan a follow-up to review results.

Alright, I'll follow your advice.

Good. In the meantime, avoid foods that worsen the symptoms and continue the omeprazole.

Understood, thank you.

Any other questions before we wrap up?

No, that's all I think.

Okay, take care, Mr. Johnson. We'll speak soon.

Thanks, doctor, see you soon.
