Transcripted Line

Good afternoon, Mrs. Thompson, great to see you again. How've you been since your last visit?

Hi, Dr. Harris. Uh, honestly, it's been a bit rough lately. I've had a lot more fatigue than usual.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. When did you notice the fatigue worsening?

Hmm, maybe about three weeks now, it feels worse than when I started chemo last year.

Are you experiencing other symptoms? Nausea, dizziness, or weight loss?

Uh, some nausea, yes. Lost a bit of weight, maybe 2kg?

I see. Are you still able to eat normally, or has your appetite changed?

My appetite has dropped, just don't feel hungry often.

Okay, noted. Let's circle back quickly. Are you still taking the ondansetron we prescribed?

Oh yes, uh, I've been taking it regularly.

Alright. Uh, can you remind me of all your current medications?

Ondansetron, um, metformin, and the levothyroxine for my thyroid. And the chemo drugs, of course.

Great, thanks for clarifying. Any new medications from other doctors?

Uh, no, nothing new.

Any allergies to medications?

Just Penicillin. It gives me a rash.

Good to have that updated. Let's review your past medical history quickly. Diabetes type II, hypothyroidism, and colon cancer stage III, correct?

Yeah, that's correct.

Any surgeries besides your colon resection two years ago?

No, just the one.

Okay, good. Have there been any changes at home or work, anything stressful?

My daughter moved back home. It's nice but a bit crowded now. She's going through a divorce, so things are a bit tense.

Oh, that sounds challenging. Any support systems in place for you both?

We've started family counseling, actually.

Oh, that's great, very proactive. Are you still smoking or drinking alcohol?

No, I quit smoking three years ago, and just an occasional glass of wine now.

Excellent, very good to hear. Let's shift gears and do a quick physical exam, okay?

Sure, go ahead.

I'm just gonna check your lymph nodes here.  Any pain or tenderness?

No, feels fine.

Good. Lungs sound clear and heart rate is regular. Can you take some deep breaths for me?

Like this?

Exactly, perfect. Breath sounds good. Let's examine your abdomen now. Tell me if you feel any discomfort.

Um, that's okay. A little tender on my left side, but not too bad.

Okay. We'll watch that. Legs seem okay, no swelling. Any numbness or tingling in your hands or feet?

Actually, yeah, a little tingling in my feet sometimes.

Noted. That could be related to the chemotherapy. We'll follow up on that. How's your sleep been lately?

Not great, um, I wake up frequently, it's hard to go back to sleep.

Have you tried anything to help with that, like melatonin or changes in routine?

I've tried melatonin, but it doesn't seem to help much.

Alright, let's see if we can address that. Any other concerns today, Mrs. Thompson?

Actually, yeah. I've been feeling pretty anxious lately, especially about my prognosis.

That's understandable. I appreciate you sharing that. Would it help if we scheduled some time to talk with our counselor here?

Yes, I'd like that.

I'll set that up today. Overall, your latest la- labs look stable, which is reassuring.

That's good to hear. Sometimes I worry about recurrence.

I totally get it, but your recent scans have been encouraging. You're responding well overall.

Good to know. And the fatigue? Is there anything we can do?

I'll recheck your iron and vitamin levels today. S- sometimes supplements can help. I'll also review your chemotherapy dose.

Okay, thank you.

You're welcome. I'll see you again in three weeks, but call me sooner if sympto- symptoms worsen.

Sure, will do. Thanks, Dr. Harris.

Mrs. Thompson. Hang in there—you're doing great.

Thanks. See you soon.

Take care.
