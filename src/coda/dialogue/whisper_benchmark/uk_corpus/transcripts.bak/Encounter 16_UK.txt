"Good afternoon. It's great to see you again. How've you been?"

"Hey, Dr. Lee. Um, you know, honestly, uh, not great. It’s been kind of rough lately."

"Oh yeah? I'm sorry to hear that. Let's talk about what's been going on. C- Can you tell me a bit more?"

"Yeah, um, I'm just still feeling really off. Like my moods are, I don't know, up and down a lot. And it's really unpredictable. I was hoping things would’ve settled by now."

"Right, I know that's been really frustrating for you. Are the mood swings more depressive, anxious, or more like irritability and energy shifts?"

"Kinda all of it? Like, I’ll have a couple days feeling pretty okay, even good, actually. And then suddenly—it's like everything crashes, and I can't get myself motivated to do anything. Then I get anxious, and…yeah, irritable too. So, it’s kind of a cycle."

"Gotcha. And you're still on the Lamictal, right? At 100 milligrams daily?"

"Yeah, still on that. Um…I'm not sure it's doing much, honestly."

"Fair enough—let's keep that in mind. Any side effects or issues tolerating the medication?"

"No…not really. Um, actually maybe headaches occasionally, but it could just be stress-related too."

"Good to know. You mentioned stress, uh, how’s work going these days?"

"Ugh—it's kinda stressful right now. Lots of deadlines and changes lately, which does not help."

"Yeah, that definitely complicates things. And sleep—how has that been?"

"Not great. Sometimes I fall asleep fine but I wake up a lot. Other nights it's just tossing and turning for hours."

"Okay. That probably doesn’t help with mood stability either. Uh, before we go on, let me just quickly review your recent labs we ordered last visit. Your thyroid panel came back completely normal—Uh, TSH is 2.1, that's totally fine. Vitamin D slightly low at 22, ideally we'd like that above 30. Could you explain some more about the fatigue or moodiness, actually."

"Hmm, I didn't know that was a thing."

"Yeah, it can definitely impact mood. I’d recommend supplementing Vitamin D—I'll put you on about 2000 IU daily, see if it helps."

"Okay, sure—I'm open to trying that."

"Great. Also, remember the MRI we did a few months ago? The results were completely normal. So, structurally, neurologically—no issues there."

"Yeah, that was a relief, honestly. 'Cause I was worried about that one."

"Completely understandable. Uh. great news there. Let's do a brief physical check. I know psychiatry visits aren't always physical, but just to be thorough. Is that okay?"

"Yeah, that's fine."

"Great. So, general appearance today: Jamie appears a bit tired, mildly anxious but cooperative, appropriately groomed. Slightly restless, um, shifting positions a bit frequently. Uh, eye contact is intermittent but mostly good. Speech is clear, normal rate and rhythm."

"No tremors or abnormal movements noted. Mood appears mildly anxious. Affect congruent with mood, slightly restricted but reactive. Thought process is logical, coherent. No overt delusions or hallucinations evident. Insight fair, judgments intact."

"Alright, physical observations seem stable from our last visit. Nothing new concerning noted, um, nothing physical."

"Good to know."

"Alright. So, let's try to clarify things. Given the ongoing fluctuations in your mood—some depressive episodes mixed with anxiety, irritability, and energy swings—it's still not entirely clear whether we're dealing strictly with depression, a mood disorder like bipolar II, or potentially an anxiety disorder component. That makes medication choice a bit tricky, honestly."

"Yeah, I feel like I've heard that before—like my symptoms don't really fit neatly into a category."

"Exactly. It's common, but it makes treatment decisions more nuanced. Uh, here's what I'm thinking: since, uh,  Lamictal at 100mg hasn't significantly stabilised your moods yet, maybe increasing slightly to 150mg could help. Sometimes mood stabilisers need dose adjustments before we see clearer effects."

"Yeah, okay. If you think that's worth trying, I'll do it."

"I do think it’s worth a careful try. Uh, we'll increase slowly—I'll give you instructions on that clearly. Uh, also, we’ll supplement Vitamin D, which could help mood and energy. And let's also add something mild for sleep, short-term, like trazodone—just 50mg at night."

"Um, okay—trazodone is, is it safe with the Lamictal?"

"Uh, yeah, totally safe together. Trazodone is gentle, often effective for sleep. It's not habit-forming. Just to help your sleep pattern normalise a bit."

"Alright, that sounds good."

"Excellent. Finally, how’s therapy been going? Uh, you're still seeing Karen regularly?"

"Yeah, every other week now. It helps, I think. It's just…slow going sometimes."

"Therapy can feel slow, absolutely. But consistency makes a huge difference over time. I'm glad you're sticking with it."

"Yeah, I'll keep going."

"Good. So, let’s summarise today's plan: so one—we're increasing, uh, the Lamictal slowly to 150mg daily, see if it improves mood stability. Two—We're going to start Vitamin D supplementation, 2000 IU daily, check again in a few months. Three—trazodone, 50mg nightly, temporarily to address sleep disruption. And four—we're going to continue with the therapy with Karen regularly, aiming for stress reduction tech- strategies and techniques."

"Alright, that's clear enough."

"Awesome. Any questions or concerns about that?"

"Um…no, I don't think so. Well—actually, how soon might I notice improvement?"

"That's a great question. Uh, the Lamictal dose might, uh,  change might take a few weeks, honestly, to fully kick in.
