Hello! I'm Dr Stevens. How are you doing today?

Hi... nice to meet you, doctor. I'm doing alright, I suppose.

Good, good. So what brings you in today?

Well, uh, I've been feeling pretty tired lately. More than usual.

Hmm. Okay, how long has this been going on?

Maybe... about three months? It's gotten worse recently.

Alright. Are there any other symptoms besides fatigue?

Uh, yeah, I've noticed some headaches, kinda mild though, and sometimes a little dizziness.

Okay, any nausea or vomiting with the dizziness?

Oh no, nothing like that.

Good. How about your sleep? Any trouble there?

Well... it takes me a while to fall asleep, but once I do, I'm usually okay.

I see. Any recent changes or stressors at home or work?

Not really. Work's been the same. Home's good, too.

Okay, good. Let's quickly go through your medical history. Any chronic conditions?

I've got asthma, but it's pretty mild.

Any inhalers or medications you're currently using?

Just salbutamol if I need it.

Got it. Have you ever had any surgeries?

No, no surgeries.

Any allergies to medications or food?

Yeah, um, latex. And I'm allergic to peanuts.

Okay. I'll make sure that's documented clearly. Do you smoke, drink, or use any recreational drugs?

I don't smoke, uh, I might have a drink once or twice a month. No drugs.

Fine. Let's go ahead and do a quick physical exam. I'll start by listening to your heart and lungs.

Alright. [cough]

Heart sounds good. Lungs sound clear. Deep breath, please.

Great. Now I'll check your blood pressure. Do you remember if it's normally high, low, or...?

Usually it's pretty normal.

Okay... 120 over 78, looks good.

Alright, that's good.

Let me take a quick look at your throat and ears.

Yeah, sure.

Throat's clear... ears look good too. Any discomfort there?

No, they're fine.

Okay, good. Well, your exam looks pretty normal. Your fatigue might just be related to your sleep or maybe a vitamin defic- deficiency.

Okay. So, what should we do next?

I'll order some basic blood work to check your thyroid and vitamin levels, and we'll follow up when those results are back. Does that sound good?

Yeah, sounds perfect.

Great. Do you have any other concerns or questions today?

Nope, that's everything.

Take care and we'll talk soon.

Thanks, you too.
