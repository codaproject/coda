Good morning, Mrs. Jacobs. It's been a while since your last visit. How are you feeling today?

Um, good morning doctor. I've been, you know, feeling pretty tired lately, actually.

Could you elaborate more on the fatigue? Is it all day or specific to a certain time?

Oh, um, it's pretty constant. Like, even when I wake up, I just feel exhausted.

Have you experienced any new symptoms alongside the fatigue—like weight loss or fever?

Yeah, actually... I think I've lost about 4kg since last month? And occasional night sweats.

Okay, noted. Um, [clears throat] have you had any fevers or chills associated with those night sweats?

I haven't checked exactly, uh, but sometimes I feel warm, like, you know, hot flashes almost.

Understood. Let's go over your medications briefly. Are you still taking the letrozole daily?

Yes, still taking letrozole every morning. I haven't missed any doses.

Good, any side effects from the medication recently?

Really, just the usual joint pain and stiffness. Nothing new there.

How about your past medical history? Any changes since your last visit?

No, just the breast cancer, hypertension, and that thyroid issue from before.

Right. You're still on levothyroxine and lisinopril, correct?

Yep, levothyroxine 75 mcg and lisinopril 10 mg.

Any allergies we need to update?

Still just latex.

Thank you. Surgical history remains the same—uh, lumpectomy and lymph node dissection, correct?

Yeah, nothing new surgically since then.

And your family history—any new cancers or other illnesses reported recently?

My mum got diagnosed with colon cancer recently.

Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. How old is she?

She's, um, 74 now.

Okay, noted. Are you scheduled for your routine colonoscopy soon?

I had one about, hmm, two years ago. It, it was normal.

Excellent. Social history—any smoking, alcohol, or drug use changes?

No smoking, no drugs, an occasional glass of wine, you know, socially.

Alright, let's move on to the physical examination. I'll start with a general exam now.

Sure.

Your vital signs are stable, blood pressure is 130/80 today. Slight elevation compared to last visit.

Yeah, I've been stressed lately, might be why.

That could contribute. Now, please let me examine your neck area briefly.

Okay.

No new lymphadenopathy. Thyroid seems normal sized. Now, let me listen to your heart.

Heart rate is regular, no murmurs. Deep breaths, please.

Lungs are clear bli- bilaterally. Any shortness of breath recently?

Not really. Just when I'm exerting myself a bit more than usual.

Understood. Now I'll check your abdomen quickly.

Okay.

No tenderness or masses. Have you experienced any abdominal discomfort lately?

No, that's been okay.

Good. And finally, let me check your arms and legs.

No swelling or abnormal findings. Are you exercising regularly?

Not as much as I should, just a bit of walking.

Exercise could help manage your fatigue. Any emotional stress you want to discuss today?

Well, yeah, my husband's health hasn't been great lately, it's, it's just all adding up.

I understand, that's certainly stressful. Have you considered speaking with a counselor or therapist?

Maybe that's something I should look into.

Provide you with a referral. Is there anything else you'd like to address today?

No, I think we covered it.

Okay, well if that's all, we'll s- set your next follow-up in three months, and I'll order some labs today to check your thyroid and CBC levels.
