Good afternoon, Mrs Thompson. It's good to see you again. How have you been feeling since our last visit?

Afternoon, doctor. Honestly, uh...not the best. I've had some more chest discomfort, on and off, you know?

Could you describe the discomfort? Is it similar to what you had before, or is it different now?

It's pretty similar, tightness in my chest, especially when I'm climbing stairs or trying to hurry.

Alright, does the discomfort radiate anywhere? Like your arm or jaw?

Sometimes to my left shoulder, but that's... not always. Sometimes just in the chest.

And how long do these episodes typically last?

Not long, maybe five minutes. If I rest, they go away, pretty quickly.

Okay. Have you noticed any shortness of breath or dizziness during these episodes?

A little breathless, yes. No dizziness though. Well, not that I've noticed.

Have you had any swelling in your legs or ankles lately?

Actually, yes, especially by the evening. My ankles have been swelling a lot.

Okay, have you noticed any weight changes?

I’ve gained about 2kg since last month, but I thought that was just holiday food.

Hmm, it's important to monitor that closely. Any changes in medications or ad- adherence issues lately?

No changes. I'm still on the same ones. Taking them regularly. I think.

Could you list them for me, just to confirm?

Sure, I'm on metoprolol... 50 mg twice a day, aspirin, 81 mg daily, atorvastatin 40 mg at night, and nitroglycerin for emergencies.

Good. Any need for nitroglycerin lately?

Yeah, I've used it two or three times this past month. It helps, but I hate the headaches it gives me.

That is a common side effect. Any issues with the aspirin or statin?

Not really. I mean, maybe some muscle pain, but nothing too bad.

Alright, noted. Have you seen any other specialists or had new tests since our last visit?

I did see my endocrinologist for my thyroid. They said everything was stable.

Remind me again of your thyroid condition. Hypothyroidism, right?

Yeah, hypothyroidism, since about ten years ago. Still taking levothyroxine, erm, 100 micrograms daily.

Okay. Any allergies to medications that you're aware of?

No.

Noted. How about your blood pressure? Have you been monitoring that at home?

Occasionally. It’s been around 140/90, sometimes higher.

Okay, let's keep an eye on that. How about your diabetes? Any issues controlling your blood sugars?

Sometimes they're high in the morning, but overall okay. I'm still on metformin, 500mg twice daily.

Have you had any new symptoms such as palpitations or increased fatigue?

I'm definitely more tired lately. No palpitations, though.

Okay. Any other medical issues we haven't touched on today?

No... Oh wait, actually, I had a mild respiratory infection two weeks ago, took antibiotics, and it cleared up.

Okay. Good to hear. Any surgeries in your past?

Just the knee replacement about five years ago.

How’s your knee doing now? Any problems walking or moving around?

It's good. No real issues besides some stiffness occasionally.

Let's quickly review your social history. Are you still a non-smoker?

Yes, I've never smoked. I don't drink either.

Excellent. Uh, and your exercise habits?

I'm trying, but honestly, it's tough with the chest issues. Maybe some walking a couple of times a week.

Okay, let’s move onto the physical exam. May I check your pulse and blood pressure first?

Sure, go ahead.

Okay. Pulse is regular, about 72 beats per minute. Blood pressure today is 146/92.

Right, I’m going to listen to your heart now.

Regular rate and rhythm. Grade 2 systolic murmur heard in the left sternal border.

That's... is that new?

It’s similar to last time. Let's check your lungs.

Mild crackles in both lung bases.

Let me see your legs... yes, significant bilateral ankle oedema. Any tenderness?

Not really. Just tightness, especially in the evenings.

Understood. Alright, I think we’ll need to adjust your medications slightly and possibly schedule some tests.

What kind of tests are you thinking?

Probably an echocardiogram and stress test, just to evaluate further.

Alright, that makes sense.

In the meantime, we'll keep monitoring your symptoms closely, and let’s schedule a follow-up soon.

Will do, doctor. Thanks so much.
