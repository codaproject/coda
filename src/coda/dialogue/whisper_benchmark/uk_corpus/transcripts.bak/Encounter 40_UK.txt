Transcripted Line

Good afternoon. I'm Dr Harris. You must be Ms Jennings?

Yes, that's me... nice to meet you.

Likewise. So, what brings you in today?

Well, I've been struggling with anxiety and I've felt really depressed lately.

I'm sorry to hear that. Can you tell me more about these feelings?

Yeah, it's like... I don't feel motivated to do anything. It's really hard even getting out of bed.

I see. And how long have these symptoms been going on?

Maybe... the last six months or so, but it's gotten worse over the past few weeks.

Have you ever felt like this before?

Yeah, I was diagnosed with depression back in college, but that was years ago.

And did you receive treatment at that time?

I was on medication. I think... sertraline? But I stopped taking it after a year.

Okay. And did it help?

Yeah, it did at first, but then I felt numb, like emotionally... flat, you know?

That's understandable. Have you been on any medications since then?

No, nothing psychiatric. But I take medication for hypertension and diabetes.

Could you list those medications for me?

Uh... metformin, 500mg twice a day, and lisinopril... I think that's 20mg.

Great, thank you. Any allergies?

Latex. I get a rash.

Noted. Um, have you had any major surgeries in the past?

Just a C-section about 10 years ago.

Got it. And any other medical conditions besides hypertension and diabetes?

I have asthma too... and arthritis in my knees.

Alright. Do you smoke, drink alcohol, or use any recreational drugs?

I smoke, maybe half a pack a day. No drugs, but I have been drinking more.

Okay, how much more? Every day, a few times a week...?

Um, pretty much every day now I guess. Not like all day, usually just at night. 

Okay, thanks for being upfront about that. Now, have you experienced any significant weight changes recently?

Yes... I've gained about 7kg over the last two months.

Any changes in appetite?

Yes, definitely eating more comfort foods... sweets, carbs, stuff like that.

What about sleep patterns?

I feel like I sleep all the time, but I'm still exhausted.

Uh, have you experienced thoughts of harming yourself or others?

No, nothing like that.

Good. Any family history of mental illness?

My mother has bipolar disorder.

Thank you. And are you currently employed?

Yes, but it's stressful. I'm a manager at a retail store.

I understand. How's your support system at home?

It's just me and my son. My family's out of state, so it's hard.

That's challenging. Let's move onto the physical exam now, if that's okay?

Yeah, sure.

Okay. Can I check your blood pressure first?

Yeah.

It's 138 over 85, slightly elevated. Let me listen to your heart and lungs.

Take a deep breath, please.

Lungs sound clear. Heart rate is normal.

Now, any tenderness or swelling in your joints?

Just a bit sore in my knees.

Mild swelling noted bilaterally. Range of motion slightly reduced.

Have you noticed any recent changes wi- with your diabetes control?

My blood sugars have been higher than usual.

We'll check an A1C today. Any questions or anything else bothering you?

I... I just feel overwhelmed by everything.

(clears throat) That's understandable. We can explore therapy options as well as medication adjustments.

That sounds good.

Do you prefer therapy, medication, or a combination?

I think a combination might be best for me.

Great. We'll set that up. Is there anything else you want to discuss?

No, I think we've covered everything for now.

Alright, Ms Jennings, we'll follow up soon. Take care.

Thank you, doctor.
