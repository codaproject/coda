"Hi, Mr. Davis, great to see you again. How have things been going since our last visit?"

"Hey, Dr. Carter. Um…honestly, not too good. My blood sugars are all over the place lately, and my back pain is worse."

"Oh, sorry to hear that. Let's tackle the diabetes first. You mentioned sugars fluctuating — what kind of numbers are you seeing at home?"

"Um…let’s see. The last couple weeks it's been bouncing between, like, 180 to sometimes even 250 in the mornings. But sometimes, like, midday it's down to 110 or 120."

"Got it. That's quite a range. How about any low sugars — anything below 70?"

"No, no lows, thankfully."

"Okay, good to hear. And remind me, you're still taking metformin 1000mg twice daily, is that correct?"

"Yeah, still taking metformin twice daily."

"Alright, I'll take a look at your recent labs. Let's see here… So, your most recent A1C from last week was 8.4%. It's up a bit from your previous 7.7%, which was about three months ago."

"Yeah, I figured it might be higher… it, it's just frustrating."

"I understand. We'll discuss medication adjustments shortly. Let’s first talk about your back pain. Can you describe what's been happening there?"

"Yeah, um, it's my lower back, mostly on the right side. It feels like a, like a stabbing pain. Worse when I move or stand up after sitting too long."

"Okay. Any numbness or tingling in your legs or feet?"

"Mmm, maybe a bit of tingling down my right leg, but it's not consistant."

"Alright, well let's do a quick physical exam. Lumbar spine: mild tenderness noted on palpation around the, around the right paraspinal muscles. No obvious deformity. Range of motion limited slightly on forward bending. Straight leg raise test negative bilaterally. Reflexes intact. Mildly decreased sensation noted along the right lateral thigh."

"Okay, and it looks like you have some muscle strain, maybe some nerve irritation. We did an MRI two weeks ago, let's review that. Uh, the MRI shows mild to moderate degenerative disc disease at L4-L5 with slight bulging disc, no significant nerve compression. So that is consistent with your symptoms."

"Okay…so that's what's causing this pain?"

"Most likely, yes. The good news here is that there is no severe compression. We can manage this conservatively with physical therapy and medication."

"Sounds fair."

"Okay, so back to your diabetes. Since your A1C has increased, I'd recommend adding a medication called Jardiance. It helps lower blood sugar and reduces heart risks. Would you be comfortable in trying that?"

"I mean, yeah, if you think it will help. Are there any side effects?"

"Some possible side effects include increased urination initially, maybe a bit of dizziness, but most tolerate it well. Just make sure you're staying hydrated."

"Oh, okay, I, I'll try it."

"Great. Uh, so let's also touch quickly on your blood pressure. Last time, it was running a bit high. Are you still taking lisinopril 20mg daily?"

"Uh, yeah, yep, still taking it."

"Okay. Today your blood pressure is 144 over 90, a little high. And what were your last month’s readings at home?"

"Uh, I think it was around 135 over 85 usually."

"Too bad but room for improvement. Let's monitor closely. We might need a second medication if it doesn't come down."

"Okay."

"Lastly, your cholesterol results from last week: LDL cholesterol is 142, which is slightly up from 130 six months ago. Your total cholesterol is 210, HDL at 45, triglycerides 150. Still slightly high then."

"Ugh, yeah, my diet hasn't been great lately. Working on it though."

"I understand, diet does play a huge role. Continue your statin and let's recheck lipids in three months."

"Yeah, that sounds good."

"Okay. So, to summarise today's plan. One: start Jardiance 10mg daily for diabetes and continue metformin. Two: physical therapy referral for your back pain, along with naproxen as needed, plus stretching exercises which I'll print out for you. Three: keep current lisinopril dose, monitor your blood pressure at home daily. and fourth, finally: continue atorvastatin, and make dietary adjustments for cholesterol."

"Okay, yeah that's clear. Is there anything else?"

"No, that's it from me. Do you have any other concerns today?"

"Mm, nope, I think, I think we covered everything. Uh, thanks for going through all that."

"Absolutely, I'm happy to help. So, let's schedule a follow-up in about 4 weeks to see how you're doing with the new medication and physical therapy."

"Yeah, perfect, I'll set that up."

"Great seeing you, Mr. Davis. Take care, and please call if anything comes up before next visit."

"Will do. Thanks, Dr. Carter."
