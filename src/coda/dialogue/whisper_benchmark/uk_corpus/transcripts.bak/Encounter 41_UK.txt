Transcripted Line

Mr Thompson, it's good to see you again. How have you been since our last visit?

Uh, hey, doc ter. Yeah, I've been... I guess okay. It's been kind of a rough few weeks.

I’m sorry to hear that. What’s been going on?

Well, I’ve been feeling really anxious again. Like, worse than before. Some days I can’t even get out of bed.

I see. Is the anxiety constant, or does it come and go?

It kind of comes in waves, but lately, it's been more constant. Especially in the mornings.

And are you still taking your medications as prescribed?

Yeah, I take the sertraline every morning, but I sometimes forget the clonazepam... especially if I’m rushing.

How often would you say you miss a dose of the clonazepam?

Maybe two, three times a week. I know I shouldn’t.

We’ll come back to that. Have you noticed any changes in your mood, like increased sadness or irritability?

I’ve definitely been more irritable. My girlfriend even said something about it.

Okay. How’s your sleep been?

Awful. I fall asleep okay, but I wake up around 3 or 4 and can’t get back to sleep.

That’s been going on for how long now?

About a month. Maybe longer.

Okay. Any new stressors recently? work, family, anything like that?

Yeah, my uncle passed away last month. We were pretty close.

I’m really sorry to hear that. That kind of loss can have a big emotional impact.

Yeah... it hit me harder than I expected.

Let’s talk a bit about your past medical history. Has anything new been diagnosed since our last visit?

No. Just the anxiety and depression. Oh, and I still have that acid reflux.

Any surgeries in the past year?

No, not since my appendix was taken out five years ago.

Medications, aside from the sertraline and clonazepam, are you taking anything else?

Yeah, omeprazole for the reflux.

Any medication allergies?

Penicillin. I break out in hives.

Got it. And just confirming, you're still living with your girlfriend?

Yeah. We moved to a new apartment actually. It's quieter, which helps.

Are you currently working?

Not full-time. I’ve been doing freelance graphic design. Money’s tight, though.

Do you smoke or drink?

I quit smoking last year. I’ll have a drink maybe once a week.

Okay, and any drug use?

I’ve been using weed again. Just at night to sleep.

How often are we talking?

Every night. Just a few hits.

Okay, we’ll discuss that in a bit. Do you exercise?

Not really. I mean, I walk my dog, but that’s it.

Okay. Let me have a look at your vitals and do a quick physical exam.

So blood pressure’s 128/82, heart rate is 76. No tremor. Pupils are reactive. No signs of distress.

Heart and lungs sounds normal. No abnormalities noted.

Any recent weight change?

Yeah, I lost like 5kg. Not trying to, though.

Over what period of time?

About two months.

Are you eating less?

Yeah, when I’m anxious, I just don’t feel hungry.

Thanks for sharing that. Going back to the weed—do you find it actually helps you sleep?

Yeah, it knocks me out. But I feel groggy in the mornings.

Grogginess can actually worsen your anxiety. We’ll need to explore alternatives.

Okay, like what?

We could look into CBT-I, which is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. Also, possibly adjusting your meds.

I’m open to that. I just want to feel normal again.

That’s a good place to start. Would you be open to increasing your sertraline dose slightly?

Yeah, if you think it’ll help.

Alright. We'll go up to 75mg and monitor closely. I’ll also refer you for therapy again.

Sounds good. Thank you.

You’re welcome. Let’s schedule a follow-up in four weeks. And if things get worse before then, call me.

Will do. I appreciate it.
