Transcripted Line

Hi there, I’m Dr Allen. It’s nice to meet you. What name do you prefer to go by?

Oh, hi. Uh, you can call me Sarah.

Great, Sarah. Thanks for coming in today. So, this is your first visit here, right?

Yeah, first time. I’ve never seen a psychiatrist before, actually.

Totally understandable. We'll take it slow. What's brought you in today?

Well, um, I’ve been feeling really down for a few months now. Like... just no energy and I cry a lot.

I’m sorry to hear that. When did you start noticing these feelings?

Maybe like… December? After the holidays, I think.

Okay. And has anything in particular happened that might’ve triggered this?

Not really. Just work’s been a lot, and my boyfriend and I broke up in November.

Breakups can be really tough. Thanks for sharing that. Are you sleeping okay?

No, not really. I keep waking up at 3 or 4 in the morning, just… wide awake.

That’s rough. How’s your appetite? Are you eating more, less...?

Honestly, less. Food just… doesn’t taste like anything.

That can definitely be part of depression. Have you ever felt this way before?

Not this bad. I mean, maybe in college I got sad during exams, but this feels different.

Got it. Any thoughts of hurting yourself or feeling like life isn’t worth living?

Um… I mean… sometimes I think about just… disappearing. But I wouldn’t do anything.

Thank you for being honest. That’s really important. Let’s talk more about that in a bit. First, I want to ask a few general health questions, okay?

Sure, yeah.

Any medical conditions you’ve been diagnosed with in the past?

Uh, just asthma. And I had mono in high school.

Okay. Have you ever had surgery?

I got my wisdom teeth out? I guess that counts.

It does! How about medications—are you taking anything regularly?

Just salbutamol, like when I need it. Oh, and birth control pills.

Do you remember the name of the birth control?

... gestimate/ethinyl estradiol, I think?

Great. Any medication allergies?

Penicillin. I break out in hives.

Thanks. Um, do you drink alcohol or use any recreational drugs?

I drink a little, like weekends. And I tried weed in college, but not recently.

Okay. Got it. And do you smoke cigarettes or vape?

No, I've never liked it.

Do you live with anyone right now?

Yeah, I live with my sister. We split a two-bedroom.

And you mentioned work being stressful—what do you do?

I’m a paralegal. It’s… a lot of long hours and not much appreciation.

That sounds demanding. And just quickly—any family history of mental health issues?

Yeah, my mom had depression, and I think my uncle was bipolar.

That’s helpful to know. Thank you. Alright, I’m just going to do a brief physical exam—mostly vitals. Is that okay?

Yeah, sure.

Alright, pulse is 72, blood pressure is 118 over 76. Breathing sounds clear. No tremor. How’s your energy level been lately?

Pretty low. I, I drag myself out of bre- bed most days.

Okay, Sarah. Based on what you’ve told me, it sounds like you might be experiencing a depressive episode. We’ll talk through some options for treatment next, but do you have any questions so far?

Uh… not yet, I don’t think so.

Okay. So, let’s talk about a couple of treatment options. The first is therapy—have you ever done any counseling or therapy before?

Nope, never. But I’ve thought about it.

That’s totally fine. I usually recommend starting with something called cognitive behavioral therapy, or CBT. It’s very practical and focused on how your thoughts affect your mood.

Okay… I- I’ve heard of that, actually.

It works well for a lot of people. The second option is medication. Some people choose to do both. Would you be open to trying a low-dose antidepressant?

Maybe. I’m nervous about side effects.

Totally understandable. Common side effects are things like nausea, mild headaches, or trouble sleeping—but they usually go away in a few weeks. We’d start low and monitor closely.

Alright… that doesn’t sound too bad.

Great. One common starter medication is sertraline—it’s been around a long time, works well, and is generally well-tolerated. I’d start you on a 25mg dose daily.

Okay. How soon would it start to work?

Usually people notice a change in 2 to 4 weeks, but the full effect can take 6 to 8 weeks.

Alright… I think I’d be willing to try it.

Okay, great. And we’ll set up a follow-up in about 4 weeks to check in. If you have any issues before then, call or message us.

Okay. Thank you.

You’re very welcome. I’m also going to refer you to one of our therapists who specialises in CBT. Does morning or afternoon work better for you?

Afternoons. I can sneak away from work then.

Perfect. We’ll have someone reach out to schedule this week.

Sounds good.

Before you go, just want to check—do you feel safe going home today?

Yeah, I do.

Alright. That’s important. And thank you again for opening up today. It takes courage.

Thanks for listening. I, I already feel a little better.

That’s what we’re here for. Take care, Sarah—we’ll talk soon.
