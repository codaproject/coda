"Hi, Ms. Bennett? Hello, I'm Dr. Evans. Nice to meet you, welcome to our p- practice!"

"Oh, hi! Uh, thank you—yeah, it's nice to meet you too."

"Great. Well, since you're new, we'll spend some extra time to get acquainted and address your concerns. Uh, so, just to start, what brought you in today?"

"Well, I just moved here from Chicago, and I have several things going on [laughter]: I've got diabetes, high blood pressure, anxiety issues, and recently joint pain. So… quite a bit."

"It's no problem at all. We'll take it step by step. So, tell me about your diabetes first. When were you first diagnosed?"

"Uh, let's see... Probably about ten years ago now. Type 2."

"Okay. Do you remember your most recent A1C reading?"

"Actually—yeah, um, here. It was two months ago, it says 8.2%. Up from the last one, which I think was around 7.5% about six months before that."

"Got it. Slightly increased. And what medications are you currently taking for diabetes?"

"I'm on Metformin, uh, 1000mg twice daily, and, um, glip- glipizide, um… 5mg, in the morning."

"Alright, great. Have you had any issues with those medications?"

"No, not really. Well, actually, sometimes the metformin does upset my stomach, but it, it’s bearable."

"Okay. We can discuss options for that shortly. Let’s move on briefly to your blood pressure. How long has the high blood pressure been an issue?"

"Probably around five years now. Um, I take, uh, lisinopril, 20 milligrams, uh, that's every day."

"Any side effects from lisinopril, like dizziness, cough?"

"Um...occasionally a cough. Uh, nothing severe, it, it's just annoying."

"Noted. Do you monitor your blood pressure at home regularly?"

"Yeah, lately around 140 over 85 or 90, sometimes higher if I'm stressed."

"Got it. Uh, we'll check your pressure here shortly. Next, anxiety. When did that become a concern?"

"I- Well, I've been anxious for a long time but was officially diagnosed around seven years ago. I'm on, uh, esc- escitalopram, um, I'm on 10mg of that daily, which... it helps a bit."

"Escitalopram. Good. Okay. Have you tried counseling or therapy?"

"Uh, I did a while back, but with moving and stuff, I, I've just lost track."

"That's understandable. We can reconnect you with a therapist here if you'd like?"

"Yeah, I'd like that."

"Alright. And lastly, the joint pain. Can you tell me more about what's going on there?"

"Yeah, it, it's been bothering me more recently. Mainly my hands and my knees— it, it's worse in the morning, it's very stiff. Um, could it be arthritis?"

"It could be, it's certainly possible. Have you had any swelling, warmth, or redness in those joints?"

"Mm, maybe a little swelling, especially around the knuckles, but it's nothing too obvious though."

"Okay, that's good to know. Um, before we move on, any other health issues, surgeries, or hospitalisations in your history?"

"Mmm… I did have gallbladder surgery about eight years ago, but that went fine. Um, and I have seasonal allergies."

"Okay. Noted. Uh, is there any family history of significant illnesses?"

"Yes. Uh, my mum has rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes, uh, my dad has high cholesterol and had a heart attack in his sixties."

"Okay. Thank you for sharing. Uh, so let's move on to a detailed physical exam. I'll just narrate as we go along, if that's okay?"

"Yeah, sounds good."

"Great. Uh, general appearance: patient appears alert, cooperative, in no acute distress. Vital signs today: blood pressure 148 over 88, pulse 78, respirations 16, temperature 98.2. Slightly ele- elevated BP noted. HEENT: pupils equal and reactive, oral mucosa moist, no dental issues. Neck: supple, thyroid normal size, no lymph nodes palpable. Heart: regular rate and rhythm, no murmurs. Lungs: clear breath sounds bilaterally. Abdomen: soft, non-tender, no masses palpated, uh, scars from prior laparoscopic gallbladder surgery noted. Extremities: bilateral mild swelling at proximal interphalangeal joints, mild tenderness, knees mildly tender, mild crepitus noticed- noted bilaterally. Neuro: normal gait, sensation intact to light touch, reflexes symmetrical."

"Okay, uh, examination does suggest inflammatory arthritis might be present. Have you ever had inflammatory markers checked, like CRP, ESR, or rheumatoid factor?"

"Hmm, no—I, I don’t think I ever had those specifically."

"Okay. We’ll definitely include those tests today. Now, you gave me recent lab results. Reviewing these quickly: kidney function at 78—slightly reduced but stable. Cholesterol panel: LDL at 135 mg/dL, HDL 42 mg/dL, triglycerides 160 mg/dL—LDL and triglycerides mildly elevated. Did you know about that?"

"Uh, yeah. Cholesterol has always been slightly high but I wasn't on medication, just watching diet mostly."

"Okay. Got it. So, with your family history of heart disease, we might discuss a medication for cholesterol management in the future."

"Yeah, okay. I'm open to that."

"Alright, so let's discuss diabetes management next. Given your recent A1C elevation, I'd suggest adding a medication like Ozempic, a weekly injectable—not insulin— um, that helps with controlling sugars and often leads to weight loss. Would you be comfortable with trying that?"

"I, I’d be okay trying that. Um, but is it painful, the injection?"

"Typically, it’s painless or some very mild discomfort. It’s a small needle, much smaller than insulin needles used to be."

"Okay, that- well, that sounds manageable."

"For blood pressure, since the cough, cough is bothersome, I'd recommend switching from lisinopril to losartan, similar benefits without the cough. Would you be okay with switching?"

"Yes, sounds good."

"Perfect. And regarding anxiety, I'll refer you to a therapist locally. Also, we can adjust medication later if needed. Do- Does that sound good?"

"Yeah, uh, I think therapy would help."

"And lastly, joint pain—I'll order some inflammatory labs: rheumatoid factor, ESR, CRP. And in the meantime, I'll prescribe naproxen 500mg as needed, with food. If labs are abnormal, we’ll consider a rheumatology referral."

"Alright, sounds good."

"Sorry, I know that's a lot to take in! Let me summarise the plan clearly. So one, add Ozempic for diabetes. Two, switch BP medication to Losartan. Three, therapy referral for anxiety. Four, order inflammatory arthritis labs, prescribe Naproxen. Five, dietary modifications for cholesterol, repeat labs in three months. And then labs today before you leave, and we'll follow-up in four weeks."

"Oh, okay, I've got it. That is clearer now!"

"Great! So, before we wrap up, do you have any other questions or concerns you've thought of?"

"Mm.... oh yeah, actually. Uh, this might sound random, but I have trouble sleeping sometimes…maybe related to anxiety?"

"It could be. We’ll monitor with therapy and follow-up. You can keep a sleep journal for the next visit?"

"Oh, that's a good idea, I, I'll do that."

"Wonderful. Anything else?"

"Nope—that, that covers everything. Thanks for spending all this time! [laughter]"

"Of course, it's my pleasure. It's really nice meeting you. So, we’ll see you in four weeks. You're welcome again!"

"Thank you so much!"
