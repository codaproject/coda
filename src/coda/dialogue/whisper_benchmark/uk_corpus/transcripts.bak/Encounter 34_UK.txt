Hi there, I’m Dr Patel. It’s nice to meet you. What brings you in today?

Hi, nice to meet you too. Um, I’ve been having some chest tightness, on and off. Just wanted to get it checked.

Okay, thanks for coming in. Can you tell me more about the chest tightness—when did it start?

Uh, maybe like three weeks ago? It’s not constant. It comes and goes.

Okay, got it. Is it worse with activity, or more at rest?

Mostly when I’m walking fast or going up stairs. But not always.

Okay. Do you ever feel short of breath with it?

Yeah, sometimes. It’s hard to tell if I’m just out of shape though.

That’s fair. Any lightheadedness or passing out?

No, nothing like that.

Okay, and have you ever had this kind of feeling before?

Not really, this is kind of new.

Alright. Let’s talk about a bit- uh, sorry. Let's talk a bit about your medical history. Any medical problems?

I have high blood pressure. Been on meds for a couple years.

Okay, which medication are you taking for that?

Um, let me think… I think it’s, um, amlodipine? 10mg?

Great. Any other meds?

Uh, just that. Oh, and... like a multivitamin.

Okay. Any allergies to medications?

Nope. Not that I'm aware of. 

Surgical history—have you had any surgeries in the past?

Yeah, I had my gallbladder out when I was 22.

Okay. And any complications with that?

No, it went fine.

Let’s move on to social history. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?

No, I quit like five years ago. Smoked for maybe ten years before that.

Good for you. Do you drink alcohol?

Uh, just socially. Like if I go out with friends or something. I don't really drink much at home.

Okay. And any recreational drug use?

Nothing like that.

And what do you do for work?

I’m a teacher. Middle school science.

Oh wow, that’s great. Brave soul.

[laughter] Yeah, it’s a lot.

Do you get regular exercise?

Well, I'm on my feet all day in the classroom, so you know, I'm not spending all day sitting down. But by the time I get home I'm just too tired to do more workouts. I don't really want to spend my weekends doing it either.

I hear you. Okay, let me take a listen to your heart and lungs now.

Take a deep breath in for me… and out… again… good.

Heart sounds are normal. No murmurs, lungs are clear. Blood pressure looks okay today.

Mm, that’s good to hear.

Yeah. I think we should do an ECG just to be safe, and maybe a stress test depending on what that shows.

Okay, sounds good.

Any family history of heart disease?

Uh, my dad had a heart attack when he was 58.

Okay, thanks. That’s helpful to know.

Is this something I should be worried about?

Well, it’s good you came in. It might be nothing, but it’s worth checking out.

Okay, yeah. Thanks for taking it seriously.

Of course. We’ll take good care of you.

I appreciate it.

Alright, we’ll get the ECG done now and go from there.

Sounds good.
