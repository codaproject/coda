Hey, good to see you again, Maria. How have you been feeling lately?

Hi Dr Anderson, um, well... honestly, not great lately.

Oh, tell me more about what's been going on.

I've been feeling so tired all the time, and I keep getting headaches.

Okay, fatigue and headaches. Have you noticed anything else new?

Yeah, some nausea on and off, especially in the mornings.

Have you been vomiting at all?

Um, a couple of times last week, but nothing major this week.

Got it. Have you taken a pregnancy test recently?

Actually, yeah—I took one yesterday, it was negative.

Right, that's good to know. And your thyroid medication, still taking the levothyroxine?

Yeah, still on the same dose—um, 100 micrograms daily.

Good. Have you had any recent changes to your diet or exercise routine?

No, but I'm frustrated 'cause I still haven't lost the baby weight.

I understand—that can be challenging. We'll definitely check your thyroid again.

Okay, good, because I'm really concerned it's still off.

Are you on any other medications besides the levothyroxine?

Just my prenatal vitamins and sometimes ibuprofen for headaches.

Ok, any allergies to medications or food?

Um, penicillin gives me hives, but that's it.

Great, noted. And remind me, any surgeries in your past?

No.

And how's your daughter doing now?

Oh she's great—she started walking last month.

Oh wow, that's exciting! Uh, must be busy at home now?

Oh my gosh, yes. She’s into everything!

[laughs] That sounds about right. So how about your stress levels? Are you feeling more stressed than usual?

Um, maybe a bit. Work has been pretty hectic lately.

Okay, remind me again, what do you do for work?

I'm a project manager at a software company.

Okay. That sounds like it could be stressful.

Yeah, the deadlines have been killing me lately.

Thats understandable. Are you getting enough sleep?

Um, I mean...maybe six hours? But interrupted often.

That might also contribute to the fatigue. Any caffeine or alcohol intake?

One or two coffees a day, and maybe a glass of wine occasionally.

Alright, that's pretty reasonable. Uh, let's do a quick physical exam, if that's okay.

Sure, go ahead.

Let me just check your heart and lungs first. Deep breaths for me.

Lungs are clear, heart sounds normal. Let's check your thyroid now.

Thyroid feels slightly enlarged. Have you had any trouble swallowing?

Now that you mention it, occasionally it feels tight.

Okay, we’ll want to get an ultrasound to check that out.

Is that something I should worry about?

Probably nothing serious, but better safe. Have you noticed any menstrual irregularities?

Um, yeah, my periods are kind of unpredictable, sometimes heavier, sometimes very light.

Alright, noted. Let's check your abdomen. Any pain or discomfort here?

No, it feels okay.

Okay. Abdomen soft, non-tender. Any breast tenderness or changes?

They've been a bit tender lately, actually.

Possibly hormonal, we'll keep an eye on it. Alright, anything else bothering you today?

Um...just feeling overwhelmed, honestly.

Understandable. Have you thought about talking to someone, like a counselor or therapist?

I've considered it, just haven't really followed through.

I think it might be beneficial. We can provide you with some resources.

Yeah, maybe that would help. Thanks.

Of course. Let's also run some labs today. A thyroid panel, CBC, and metabolic panel.

Sounds good.

Perfect. I'll have the nurse set that up. Anything else you need from me today?

No, that's all, thank you so much.

You're welcome. Take care, Maria, and we'll follow up when the results come in.

Thanks, Dr Anderson. See you soon.
