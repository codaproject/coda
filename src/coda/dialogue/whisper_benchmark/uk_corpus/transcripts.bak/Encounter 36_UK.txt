Good morning, I'm Dr Hernandez. Thank you for coming in today. How are you feeling?

Good morning. I'm doing alright, thank you.

Great. So, this is your first visit with us, correct?

Yeah, it is.

Alright. Let's start by getting a bit of your medical history. Have you had any major illnesses in the past?

No, not really. I've generally been healthy.

Any chronic conditions like diabetes, hypertension, or thyroid issues?

Um, I was told I had slightly high thyroid levels during my last pregnancy.

Okay. Were you treated for that with medication?

Yes, they put me on levothyroxine.

Are you still taking that now?

No, I stopped after delivery. My doctor said it looked fine at follow-up.

Understood. Any surgeries in the past?

Just a C-section with my last baby.

Got it. And any other procedures?

No, that’s it.

And are you taking any medications currently?

No, nothing new, uh, nothing now, even.

Any allergies to medications or anything else we should know about?

Nope. Not that I know of.

Okay, sounds good. Now let’s talk a bit about your social history. Do you smoke or use any tobacco products?

No, never.

Any alcohol or recreational drug use?

No drugs. I have a glass of wine most nights wh- after my kids go to bed.

Okay, that’s noted. And what do you do for work?

I'm a teacher, middle school.

Oh, that's a tough job. Um, let's see, are you currently sexually active?

Yes.

Any concerns in that area—pain, discomfort, anything unusual?

No, everything’s been normal.

And your menstrual cycles—are they regular?

Yes, about every 28 to 30 days.

Any issues with cramping, heavy bleeding, or spotting between periods?

Um, maybe a little heavy the first couple of days, but nothing too bad.

Alright. And when was your last menstrual period? (clears throat)

I think about three weeks ago?

Okay. And are you currently using any contraception?

Uh, no. I have an IUD.

Um, do you know which type? Hormonal or copper?

Hormonal.

Thanks. Alright, I’m going to go ahead and perform a physical exam now. Is that okay?

Sure.

Alright, blood pressure is 118 over 72. Heart rate is normal. No abnormalities noted on breast exam. Let me just... okay, pelvic exam is also normal.

Okay, that’s good.

Everything looks good today. If you have any questions or concerns that come up later, don’t hesitate to reach out.

Thank you, I appreciate it.

You’re welcome. We’ll see you again in a year unless something comes up sooner.
