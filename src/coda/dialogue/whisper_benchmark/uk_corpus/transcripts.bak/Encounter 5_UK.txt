"Hey there, Mr. Andrews! Good to see you again. How've you been holding up?"

"Hey, Dr. Patel. It's- you know, hanging in there. Been, uh, kind of a rough few months, honestly."

"Yeah, it sounds like it. So, let's talk about what's been going on. Your notes mentioned chest discomfort returning and some issues with shortness of breath again?"

"Right. Uh, the chest pain came back probably a few weeks ago. It's not every day, but... maybe a few times a week. It's worse when I'm walking or I'm climbing upstairs. And I've also noticed that I'm just getting winded more easily again."

"Okay, I'm sorry to hear that. Sounds like exertional angina possibly returning. Have you tried nitroglycerin when it happens?"

"Yeah, I, I used it a few times. It helps a little bit, but not as much as it used to, I think."

"Alright. That's helpful to know. And how about swelling—any leg swelling or weight gain recently?"

"Actually, yeah, definitely noticed my ankles puffing up more, um, especially by the evening. My wife mentioned it, too."

"Gotcha. And remind me again—you're still taking the furosemide, 40 mg twice a day?"

"Yep, still on the furosemide, uh, twice a day, yeah. But I missed a few doses here and there because, you know, I'm just busy and forgetting sometimes."

"Sure, that's understandable. But it might explain some swelling. We'll circle back to that in just a moment. How about your energy levels, are you feeling fatigued or anything else going on?"

"Yeah, energy is definitely lower lately. I feel like I need naps more often, even though I'm sleeping okay at night."

"Okay, that's good information to know. Let's quickly review your recent tests together. You had an echocardiogram two weeks ago—your ejection fraction came back about 35%, down slightly from 40% six months ago. That's possibly why symptoms are getting worse."

"Right, okay. So that's not great news?"

"Well, it's not ideal, but we can manage this. And your labs: uh, your BNP level—that heart-failure marker—is elevated at 1200, up from 900 previously. Your potassium and kidney function look good though: potassium at 4.1, creatinine stable at 1.0."

"Well, at least something looks okay."

"Right, exactly. Your cholesterol panel also came back. LDL cholesterol is 95—actually improved from 110 last time. The statin seems to be working well."

"[laughter] Good, glad something’s working!"

"Yes, agreed. Let's do a quick physical exam now. I'll talk through it as we go, okay?"

"Yeah, sure, sounds good."

"Alright, general appearance: Mr. Andrews is alert, conversational, comfortable at rest. Heart rate today is around 82, blood pressure 138 over 84, slightly elevated but stable. Respiratory rate normal at 16 breaths per minute."

"Listening to your heart now: regular rhythm, but mild S3 gallop noted today, consistent with fluid overload. Lungs sound clear at rest, thankfully—no crackles or fluid sounds currently."

"Checking your abdomen: soft, non-tender, but mild fullness noted, possibly mild ascites developing. Checking your legs…yep, mild-to-moderate bilateral edema noted up to mid-shins today."

"Yeah, they've been like that for a couple of weeks now."

"I see. Okay, physical exam findings align with your symptoms and the echo findings. Let's move on to what we should do next, alright?"

"Yeah, sounds good. You know I trust you."

"I appreciate that. First thing—we need to better manage this fluid retention. You're on furosemide already, but since you're symptomatic again, I'd recomm- I'd recommend we increase your fur- furosemide dosage slightly, from 40 mg twice daily to 60 mg twice daily for now."

"Okay. Um, is that going to cause any…issues?"

"Good question. Mainly, we’ll watch your electrolytes carefully, especially potassium levels. You might notice increased urination, obviously. Uh, we’ll recheck labs in one week to make sure everything looks okay."

"Alright, I can handle that."

"Next, regarding your angina symptoms returning despite nitroglycerin, I think it's wise to schedule a repeat cardiac catheter- catheterisation soon. Your last one was about two years ago, is that correct?"

"Yeah, roughly two years ago. Uh, they put in a stent at that time."

"Right, in your RCA. With symptoms recurring, we just need to be sure that stent is still open and that no new blockages are present. Does that sound reasonable?"

"Yeah, it makes sense. Uh, is it going to be soon, or…?"

"Yes, ideally within the next couple of weeks. I'll coordinate that with cardiology scheduling today."

"Alright. And it's, it's still outpatient, right?"

"Typically, yes. Unless we find something needing immediate intervention. But we'll cross that bridge if it comes to it."

"Fair enough."

"Good. Uh, also, continue the car- carvedilol, 12.5 mg twice daily, and Entresto, 49/51 mg twice daily. Those medications are crucial to supporting your heart function. And definitely, please try to avoid skipping the Lasix doses."

"Okay, I'll set alarms on my phone or something."

"Perfect. And lastly, for fatigue, try to manage activity by pacing yourself throughout the day. Short, frequent rests can help. Also, consider dietary sodium reduction to under 2000 mg per day to help fluid issues."

"Right, right… Yeah, I've probably been slipping a little on sodium, honestly."

"It's understandable, it happens. Just try your best to cut back again. It really helps manage fluid and your overall symptoms."

"I'll focus on that again."

"Excellent. Let me quickly recap today's plan clearly: So, one—increase furosemide dosage, recheck labs next week. Two—schedule cardiac catheterisation soon to reassess coronary arteries and stent. Three—maintain carvedilol and Entresto at current doses. Four—reduce dietary sodium intake, manage daily activities carefully to combat fatigue."

"Got it, Dr. Patel. Clear as always."

"Any other questions or concerns today, Mr. Andrews?"

"No, I, I think that's pretty much everything."

"Alright, great. It's always good chatting with you. Uh, let me know if anything changes before your procedure. Otherwise, we’ll review everything after the cath."

"Will do. Thanks for everything."

"My pleasure. Take care now."
