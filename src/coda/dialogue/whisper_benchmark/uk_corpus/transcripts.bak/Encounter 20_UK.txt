Transcripted Line

"Hey Alex, great to see you again! Come on in, have a seat."

"Hi, Dr. Morgan. Thanks. Uh, good to see you too."

"So, it's been about a month since last time, right? How've things been going for you lately?"

"Um…I mean, kind of all over the place, honestly. It's a lot of ups and downs again, you know?"

"Yeah, I remember last time we talked about mood swings and anxiety being pretty tough. Has anything changed since then, gotten better or worse?"

"Uh…I don't know. Maybe anxiety's a bit worse lately. Like, I’m having more trouble getting myself to leave the house sometimes, you know?"

"Yeah, gotcha. Erm, is that anxiety related to anything specific—social situations, crowds—or is it just kind of generalised?"

"A bit of both, honestly. But definitely worse around people. I just start feeling super self-conscious, like people are looking at me, judging or something."

"Yeah, that sounds pretty tough. Erm, how about your depressive symptoms—are you still feeling down, hopeless at times?"

"Yeah, some days are better, but then others… it's like… I just feel totally unmotivated, kind of empty."

"Right. I'm sorry you're still feeling that way. Um, you're still on the sertraline—100 mg daily, right?"

"Yeah, still taking that every morning. But…I'm not really sure it's helping as much as it used to."

"That's fair enough. And last time, we talked about possibly adjusting the dose or even adding something else. Are you still open to considering that?"

"Yeah, definitely. I'm kind of ready to try something else, honestly."

"Okay, that's good to know. Erm, before we jump into meds, I just wanna quickly, uh, check about sleep—last time it was rough. Has there been any improvement there?"

"Mmm…not really. I'm still waking up a lot. And it's hard to fall asleep too—my mind just races, especially lately."

"Yeah, gotcha. Erm, that probably isn't helping mood or anxiety either."

"No, definitely not."

"Er, by the way, how's work been? Are you still at the coffee shop?"

"Oh, yeah—still there. Um, shifts have been a little stressful lately. New manager, lot of changes, its kind of chaotic."

"Ugh, that's tough. Change can be super stressful, especially when anxiety's high already."

"Yeah, it's definitely adding to it."

"Alright, let's keep that in mind too. So, medication-wise, since anxiety seems worse, we might consider something to augment the sertraline, maybe buspirone or something similar. Have you ever tried that?"

"Um, no, I don’t think so. Is it, like, addictive or anything?"

"-forming. Er, it's pretty mild, it usually helps with generalised anxiety symplem- symptoms. Erm, it can also help the antidepressant work better for anxiety."

"Okay. Yeah, I think I'd be willing to try that."

"Good. Er, let's try buspirone, erm, maybe 10 mg twice daily to start, see how it goes. And, er, for the sleep—maybe we can also try adding something mild, like a low dose of trazodone, just temporarily to help break the insomnia cycle. Have you ever tried that one before?"

"Mmm, no I haven't. Is it safe to take with sertraline?"

"Oh yes, perfectly safe. Low dose—maybe 50 mg at night. Erm, it can help your brain settle down, reduce that racing feeling."

"Yeah, okay. I'd be open to that too."

"Great. Also, er, therapy-wise, er, have you still been seeing Jenny- ah, Jenna regularly?"

"Yeah, every other week. It's been okay—I mean, helpful, but sometimes it feels repetitive, you know?"

"Yeah, sure, therapy can feel slow sometimes. Erm, maybe talk with Jenna about changing things up a little—erm, maybe some different approaches like CBT or mindfulness strategies, it might refresh things a bit."

"Yeah, that's a good idea. I'll mention it next session."

"Awesome. Er, let me quickly summarise today's plan then: Er, first, we're going to keep sertraline at 100 mg daily. Second, we'll add the buspirone, 10 mg twice daily, to address the anxiety. Third, we'll add some trazodone, 50 mg at night temporarily for sleep. And fourth, we'll continue the therapy but consider discussing new strategies with Jenna."

"Okay, that sounds good. It's clear enough."

"Okay. Great. Anything else on your mind today?"

"Uh…oh, yeah, actually. I've noticed lately, um…my appetite’s been kinda off. Like, some days I'm not hungry at all, others I just can't stop eating."

"Oh, that's interesting. Erm, it's probably mood-related, but we should monitor that. Sometimes medication changes can help even- er like even out the appetite issues too. Er, keep track, and we'll revisit that next visit, okay?"

"Alright, will do."

"Good. Er, any other questions or anything else you wanna discuss?"

"Um…no, I think that's it for now."

"Alright, Alex. Well, hang in there—you're really doing great keeping up with all this. It's always nice talking to you."

"Thanks, Dr. Morgan. I really appreciate it."

"Anytime. Reach out if you need anything before our next appointment, okay?"

"I will. Thanks again."

"Take care!"
