Transcripted Line

Good morning, I’m Dr Jensen. Thanks for coming in today. What brings you in?

Morning, doctor. Um... I’ve been having some stomach iss- uh, stomach pain, kind of off and on for the past few weeks.

Okay, can you describe the pain for me? Sharp, dull, burning?

It’s like a dull ache, sometimes cramping. Mostly in the upper part of my stomach.

And when did it start exactly?

Maybe three... no, four weeks ago? Around then.

Does anything make it better or worse?

Eating sometimes makes it worse.

Any nausea, vomiting, or change in bowel movements?

Yeah, some nausea. No vomiting. Uh, bowel movements are pretty normal, I think.

Okay. Any weight loss, fever, or fatigue?

Not really. Maybe a little more tired than usual, but no fever or weight loss.

Got it. Do you have any medical problems that you’re aware of?

I have high blood pressure. It’s been controlled for a few years now.

Okay. And any past surgeries?

Just my appendix when I was a teenager.

And what medications are you currently taking?

Just lisinopril. I think it’s 10mg? Once a day.

Okay. Do you have any allerg- allergies to medications?

Uh, penicillin. It makes me break out in a rash.

Any history of ulcers, acid reflux, or similar issues in the past?

No, nothing like that. This is kind of new for me.

Okay. Can I ask a bit about your lifestyle? Do you smoke or drink alcohol?

I don’t smoke. I drink... maybe once a week? Just a beer or two.

Any recreational drug use?

No, none of that.

And what do you do for work?

I work in IT, mostly remote. So I sit a lot.

Okay. And diet-wise, would you say it’s balanced, or...?

Um, could be better. Uh, a lot of takeout lets- lately. Busy days.

That's understandable. Okay, I’m going to do a quick exam, alright?

Sure.

I’m just going to press on your abdomen here... let me know if anything feels tender.

Okay... yeah, right there, yeah, that’s a bit sore.

Upper middle?

Yeah, like just below the ribs.

And any pain when I press here on the lower sides?

No, that’s fine.

Okay. Bowel sounds are normal... no guarding or rigidity.

I don't feel any masses. That’s good.

So, based on your symptoms and the exam, it could be something like gastritis or a mild ulcer.

Oh. Is that serious?

Not usually, but we’ll want to confirm. I’ll order some labs and maybe a breath test for H. pylori.

Okay.

In the meantime, try to avoid spicy foods, caffeine, and NSI- NSAIDs. Um, I’ll also give you a medication to reduce acid.

Got it. Um, what was that last part again?

A medication to reduce stomach acid. It should help to relieve the pain while we investigate.

Alright, thanks.

You’re welcome. We’ll follow up once we have the results.
